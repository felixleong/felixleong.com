How many times does one fall in love  
to someone that is so beautiful and dear  
and unable to grasp and hold it close

My gaze remain locked  
at this beautiful thing  
swimming about gracefully  
without any concern of the attention it receives

I clasps my hands together  
On one hand, it's as if I'm begging  
for it to come to me  
While on the other, letting my internal tensions  
fade away through my fingertips  
slowly, gently, with ease…  
and to let it go…
