I drew the panda – at least that's something small that I'd brag about :p.

And yeah, as much as they are so stealth that I don't know the details, if you are using email to handle support queries, <a href="http://sapo.to/">you'd be interested in joining the mailing list at http://sapo.to/</a> for an upcoming solution for your support email hell.
