I'm a believer of the law of attraction: not the "ask and you shall receive" kind but more like the whatever you are now experiencing in life is of your own creation kind.

I stumbled upon the thought when I contemplated the present situation of mine and noticed my perceptions towards my co-workers: to me, it seems that I conveniently match their personality profiles with those of my ex-colleagues whom I've worked with. And in a way, I probably have interacted with them in a similar fashion based on the stereotypes or personality buckets that I've assigned them to.

The way I've described it over a Twitter conversation goes like I'm wearing a rose-tinted glass that I had fixated and interpreted my present with a past environment that I'm familiar with. And a really profound response I got is a question: maybe I'm seeing things I wanted to see.

That got me thinking: how many times have I relied on too heavily on the perceptive shortcuts based on experience? Is the canned responses that I had prepared and known to have worked right in the present situation?

The more important question would probably be: am I willing to see the present situation with fresh eyes? If not, am I hiding behind the blinders of the past?

This ties into the introspection theme on whether did I created my loop of life: the deja-vu of past experiences replayed again in the present?{%- endmark %}
