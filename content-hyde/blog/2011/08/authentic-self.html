We are born pure, without pretension.

I may have grown up to whoever I am now, and yet it's possible that I may not be completely born yet. I've been raised and get used to following and chasing what others has told us to do, what ideals we should pursue, what standards to meet. From time to time, I feel a cry from within – a thug felt in the heart, sorrow and misery seeping in and felt through my veins.

What do I feel, I could not explain.

May be, just may be, there's an inner baby within myself – wanting to be born, to see the world with fresh eyes. If that's true, please let it be born: breaking away the husk, the shell and the façade, let me be alive again!

That's my proclamation to the world.

P/S: Yes, if you noticed the year in the signature, it is one of the older art I've drawn that I've forgotten to upload as I decided to change the format of my blog posts.{%- endmark %}
