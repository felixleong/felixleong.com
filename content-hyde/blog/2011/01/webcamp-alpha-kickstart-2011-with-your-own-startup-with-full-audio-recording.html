Yesterday's monthly event is a total blast with successful entrepreneur and angel/scout Chris Hong and two founders of a young startup called <a href="http://wootfood.com/">Wootfood</a>, TJ Tee and Clayton, sharing their lessons and experience in building products and successfully launching their startups.

I have the whole session recorded using my iPod Touch and quality is surprisingly good as a guerrilla recording device. If you are interested in startups, <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?w360cj3o25od97v">download and listen to the full, 2-hour audio recording</a>.{%- endmark %}
