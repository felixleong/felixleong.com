{% mark post -%}Although I am perfectly fine now, yet from time to time, I still missed you. Although it seemed that I have already disassociated that special feeling with you, but somehow there's times when I still remembered that feeling when I'm by your side.

"Did things ever change?", I wondered. There are times when I reached out into the thin air, hoping of getting hold of something.

No matter how time has passed, seemingly some things never fades away.

Was just being by your side good enough, even though I'd never reach to you…? Somehow at the moment I just feel grateful that it had lasted a little while longer.

Until the day comes, I can only continue to pray that I will still continue to grow along my journey… that's all to it.{%- endmark %}
