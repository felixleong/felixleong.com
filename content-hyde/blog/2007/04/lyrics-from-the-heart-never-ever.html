{% mark post -%}<strong>NEVER EVER / 浜崎あゆみ</strong>
いつか生まれる前からきっと
変らないモノ探し続けては
見つけて　失って　時に
人をキズつけた夜もあった

もしもたったひとつだけ願いが叶うなら
もしもたったひとつだけ願いが叶うなら
君は何を祈る
この空に君は何を祈る

強く欲しがる気持ちのそばで
どこか諦め覚え始めては
見つけて　手放して　時に
自分をキズつけた夜もあった

もしも君に差し出せるモノがあるとすれば
もしも君に差し出せるモノがあるとすれば
変らぬ確かな思い

ほんの少しでも笑ってくれるなら
まだココに生きる意味もあるよね
ほんの少しでも求めてくれるなら
まだココに生きる事許されるかな

もしもたったひとつだけ願いが叶うなら
もしもたったひとつだけ苦いが叶うなら
君は何を祈る

ねえ　もしも君に差し出せるモノがあるとすれば
もしも君に差し出せるモノがあるとすれば
変らぬ確かな思い
そう変らぬ確かな思い
ねえここに

NEVER EVER / Ayumi Hamasaki</strong>
<a href="http://ayumi.primenova.com/lyrics/neverever.htm">[Lyrics translation from Divine Ayu]</a>
 Sometime, surely since before you were born,
I was searching for something unchanging.
I'd find it, and lose it, and sometimes
there were nights when I hurt people.

If just one of your wishes could come true,
If just one of your wishes could come true,
what would you wish for?
What would you wish for, here, under this sky?

Despite my strong desire,
I started giving up.
I'd find it, release it, and sometimes
there were nights when I hurt myself.

If there were something I could give to you,
If there were something I could give to you,
It would be my unchanging, certain thoughts.

If you'll laugh for me, even just a little,
then there's still a reason for me to live here.
If you'll search for me, even just a little,
then maybe my living here will be accepted.

If just one of your wishes could come true,
If just one of your wishes could come true,
what would you wish for?

If there were something I could give to you,
If there were something I could give to you,
It would be my unchanging, certain thoughts.
Yes, my unchanging, certain thoughts.
Right here.{%- endmark %}
