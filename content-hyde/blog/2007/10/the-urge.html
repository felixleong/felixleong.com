{% mark post -%}Bloody tempted with the LG KU250 at the moment, what started as a &lt;RM500 hunt ended up me finding out about this, which is one the cheapest 3G phone that can be found in Malaysia with an impressive feature set that I wanted (memory card expansion, Bluetooth, 1.3MP cameraâ€¦ too bad it doesn't have FM radio but I can live with that). It is RM150 more expensive than my budget but i might well think of as "future-proof" tax hold on to it for another 3 years :).

Originally planned to get it in November as my birthday present, might as well as get it soon to get my shopping list shorter :).

In other news, was currently back into reading self-help books. Can say that I needed the slight push at the back at the moment.

Guess that's pretty much what I needed to say at the moment.{%- endmark %}
