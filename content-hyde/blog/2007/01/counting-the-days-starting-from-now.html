{% mark post -%}Day two, and I don't feel like counting it up anymore. -_-||

Everything is pretty much normal as usual, except for some minor details that one may or may not be able to notice… subtle changes. Somehow it just felt as the people around me had knew in one way or the other.

Ripples of emotions can still be felt, to be honest… is it bearable compared to the past? I'm not too sure about in terms of comparison of degrees, but it seemed that I still manage it now. Although there's that small disappointment that yearns for physical and emotional warmth and closeness from time to time… it can't be helped at the moment as it's something unfulfilled up until now.
