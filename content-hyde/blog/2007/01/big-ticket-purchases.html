{% mark post -%}Starting to get some really big ticket purchases, and to be honest it's more of a whim of mine than anything. As seems as if I wanted to put some extra challenges in planning my budget? Or probably I feel like enjoying a little more, with a little bit of risk in my own life? Starting from now, my account books are going to be a bit rocky and balancing them out would be more challenging that last year :).

Think it'd just about time for me to get a bit more creative in this aspect.

Anyway, my current and future list (planned) which I had in mind at the moment:

Now - California Fitness Infinity membership (i.e. lifetime, yearly prepaid membership): installments starts from next month for two years

May - Cambodia trip, estimated budget would be around RM1000, although I think RM1500 would be a better estimate because I have to fork out RM300 for the international passport. Intensive saving starts from next month

June - December 2007 - Prepare a budget hit when I move out with my aunt. But planning to expand my parapara video collection. Needs to learn some new dances these days, I definitely don't want to kept myself stuck in the third boom period :). Probably will interleave that between my manga collection and CD collection

2008 - Aimed items: Contact lens, if my condition allowed me to do so, Nintendo DS, and possibly a new apartment that I like? The last one sounds like a great learning curve on my part, hopefully I can work it out, otherwise achieving that by 2009 is also nice enough :)

2009 - I think a new iPod have to wait until then? Hope my CD collection won't grow exponentially before that ^^||. I'm already having difficulty choosing what albums *not* to include in my tracklist already.


As much as I had my intangible wish list, but it's impossible to know what the future holds (at least it'd be easier to drop items from my tangible list anyway)… so… well, I think I would adopt that "Do my best and don't expect anything in return" mindset for that one.

Hope I can work it out :).{%- endmark %}
