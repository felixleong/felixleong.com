{% mark post -%}Just for the record, caught a flu today, although it didn't turn out to be a full fledged flu attack (probably because I had Panadol yesterday, knowing that I might be getting a cold). But blegh, it's still nasty: my throat is slightly inflamed and sore throats were never nice to have. Not to mention the minor pain on the joints and muscles.

Hope I get well soon enough, say, tomorrow?{%- endmark %}
