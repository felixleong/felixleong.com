{% mark post -%}当自己认为自己没什么大问题当时，实际上是如此吗？
虽然自己对人说“没问题”的那时，心中还是感到彷徨：仍然怀疑着自己以后是否还能支撑下去。

是担心未来的未知数吗？还是不能表露脆弱显得比较痛苦？
似乎自己坚强的背后，仍然还是希望得到一些关怀安慰；每一句话的背后，隐隐还是透漏些小小的期望。

The time when I think that I'm OK, is it really the case?
Although when I say "no problem", deep down I'm still feeling anxious: still suspicious whether I can still hold on like this in the future.

Is it that I'm worrying about the uncertainties of the future? Or is it that it's more painful when I can't show my fragility?
Seems that behind my strong exterior, I'm still wishing to be cared and consoled; behind every sentence, there's still some small hopes hidden behind them.{%- endmark %}
