{% mark post -%}Probably I was the one who chose the path to be alone most of the time, either I'm aware of the fact or not. However, being human, I also desired for support and care from others. Maybe I'm not that well in expressing myself? (Hmmâ€¦ not sure what is cause and what is effect, seems that both are chained together in some way or the other)

I do wonder, whether is it possible to find a certain person: a great resonance, a great harmony between two? Someone that I'm able to grow together with in an internal sense? Just felt that there's no way to reach a conclusion other than a continuous searching which might prove to be fruitless.

Other than that, it just remains a possibility. Nothing else than that.{%- endmark %}
