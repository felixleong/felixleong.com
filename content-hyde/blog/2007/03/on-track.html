{% mark post -%}Nothing much happening these days, really. Mostly just keeping tabs with my own life as I was in a much stable emotional state (well… not to say that it doesn't have its ripples) and there aren't anything to do at work at the time.

I personally revise my financial situation and I think I finally able to accumulate my emergency cushion this month :). (at the moment my definition of it being 3 months take home pay and/or 6 months monthly expenses) It's pretty much a great achievement on my part. At the moment I'm planning to stick to my current financial plan and expenses sheet for as long as I could and keeping any major purchases till next year. If everything goes according to plan, I think I'm able to save enough for prepare for the next big thing: my own place to live in :D. A small but comfy apartment unit in PJ/KL with all sort of living convenience around me would be just the ideal spot. But looking at how much I'm able to accumulate, probably I can only start to do so, say… three years from now? As much as I would be a bit disappointed for not getting it next year (I'm just one impatient guy :p), but it'd probably be on the safe side and it's definitely achievable without having myself making much sacrifice (provided that my income was stable during this period of time).

At the moment I think it's better for me to do more homework and prepare myself (in many aspects) to achieve it. For one thing it's not going to be easy for sure, but I think I can work out the equation somehow.

And yeah, at the moment I find myself staring blank at my LJ screen as I find myself lacking anything interesting to write about. And seemingly it's much easier for me to write drifting thoughts and impromptu posts when I'm in a sentimental mood with some sort of a clear track of the ideas that I would like to discuss and share. ^^||| Just one of those days, I guess.{%- endmark %}
