{% mark post -%}Just sort of came to me… the question on how we form a certain "model" of the world: our so-called "world view". With the monstrous amount of information being fed to us (not to mention their own validity and correctness was not put into consideration) and the intensity of influences that not only mould our experiences but also forms the basis of our current thoughts and actions, the "influential" factors that forms our perceptions seemed to be infinite.

Tackling these issues from both intellectual and experiential "processing", I'm starting to wonder how much "reliability" that our "interpretations" actually have? After all, there's only that much past data can be relied on as the situations changes over time, not to mention all the noise and ambiguity is more likely to corrupt "reality" as soon as it was delivered.

Probably that's what we say as the accumulation and forming of laws of truth and the exploration of deeper understanding, hence increasing the "reliability" of "interpretation" to a "practical" measure (i.e. just enough information to yield our so-called "positive" results") or in our own social terms being "matured". But the meaning of "truth" is pretty subtle and subjective, together with the concept of "maturity", "positive" and "reliability"… I believe it still depends on the different aspects of humanity and the ability to explain those terms in a concise manner. By all means, it seemed to me that generalization and unification of the actual meaning that applies to all different, subtle aspects doesn't seem to exists. Even if it exists, it's bound to create different "interpretation" among different people, hence the unique "maya" of the minds and thoughts of others…

…

To be honest, I don't think I'm being in any way coherent here. Just felt like just typing whatever that goes into my brain at the moment. At least it had been like this for the past few days. Sort of made me think what and how those Tachikomas (from Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex) sees the world…{%- endmark %}
