{% mark post -%}Just a plug to those who knew or interested about the previous tech blog that I had: <a href="http://digitalbluewave.blogspot.com/">The Digital Blue Wave</a> is back to its second home at Blogger. Originally itâ€™s going to be hosted at my personal web space but I sort of became lazy, so there you are.

Will be create a custom CSS theme for it, but probably I might as well keep it as simple as possible.

And yeah, most likely my Japanese blog would be hosted there as well so that I can share the CSS somehow.{%- endmark %}
