{% mark post -%}With our perception and knowledge only capable to be expanded in a finite space, my thoughts and beliefs of "infinity" is nothing more than just a hypothesis in the plane of thoughts.

If the concept of "infinite" is true, then how shall one be able to reach the state of complete boundlessness?
