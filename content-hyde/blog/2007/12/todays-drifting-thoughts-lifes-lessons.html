{% mark post -%}Currently I'm facing the greatest life lessons in life: one of the greatest challenge that I feared the most and find myself being the most unprepared. It's not a challenge that I can describe in a few words as I'm unable to contain such multi-faceted situation in a certain box. What I really hope that I'm not getting into, now by necessity, becomes the most vital lessons that I have to learn now.

This pretty much opens a whole new, unknown world to me which I can no longer predict what the future holds: as my decision now will drive and mould what I'll be from now on.

If I were to really pinpoint what the challenge was, it was getting over the fear of my very own expansion that breaks the small, secure shell that I used to know. Opening a whole new wide world filled with challenges, I have to overcome my fear of failure, ignorance of risks and the insistence of a independent soul which will never know how to reach out for others for the resources that I wanted. I have to learn how to take risks and making mistakes and expect to pay the price for the rewards that I wanted to achieve.

In such a world, social skills, the ability of leading oneself and others, the ability to utilise whatever that is available in our environment, the confidence and insistence in maintaining and upholding my own ideals and making the necessary plans and arrangements in achieving my own goal has shown its greatest importance which influenced me to no longer be ignorant any more. Heck, it's more like a hard slap in my head and I definitely appreciate the reminder and hope this reminder will continue in the future until the value was hardly infused into my programming.

From tomorrow onwards will be the defining moments in my life and from there on there's more planning, goal setting and soul-seeking in my life. I have to learn to not squander my life and seek every means to enrich myself. At the moment what I'm doing now is to read as much as I could (aiming for a 24 books a year goal), practice whatever I find to suit me and have the ones that worked to be part of myself. Not only that, I need to gather all my energies and determination to say goodbye to my "old self", seek a new direction in life which will guide me to my own paradise and embrace whatever changes that is needed.

That's my commitment to myself.{%- endmark %}
