{% mark post -%}虽然好多时候忘记了，偶尔悠然想起那熟悉的笑颜的时候，看到一直以来都得到的，那隐约的幸福。

会心一笑，默默地对你们说“谢谢你，我确实收到你们给我的幸福了”。

生活继续地延续着，提醒着自己抬起头，往前看，继续踏上自己的旅途。

<em>“大丈夫だよ…”</em>

Although many times I have forgotten, sometimes I remembered that smile on your face, and able to see the happiness that I had received unknowingly.

Smiling from the heart, I said to you softly “Thank you for all the love and happiness you have brought to me”.

Life continues to move on, reminding me to raise my head, look forward and continue to set on my journey.

<em>“Everything’s going to be OK…”</em>{%- endmark %}
