It's been about four years (if not more) that my personal homepage had been stagnant and have seen it moving hosts at various point of time. Having finally converted in a WordPress format, by all means, notes a brand new beginning.

By all means, the "PEDAGOGIES" (that's the title of my previous website) era had came to an end and the purpose of the site had changed from a purely manga drawing tutorial site into something yet unknown. And yup, you read "unknown" right: as I have yet to come up with a clear goal what this site shall achieve (mainly also due to the fact that the myraid of services that I used did their job very well, be it <a title="Personal weblog" href="http://felixleong.com/" target="_blank">LiveJournal</a>, <a title="Personal art gallery" href="http://felixleong.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a> or <a title="Personal Twitter account" href="http://twitter.com/felixleong" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).

So by all means, this site shall be my experimentation grounds of trying out new content and let it take its own shape at its own accord. So hopefully I'll be able to put on my creative thinking cap and come up with something original this time round.

By the way, I'll be posting the old manga tutorials back up again sometime later (mainly for archiving purposes). Would really need some time to clean the HTML up to suit this new platform ;-).{%- endmark %}
