{% mark post -%}… and awaiting for their turn to be read:<br /><ul><li>A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton G. Malkiel</li><li>Being In Love by Osho</li></ul>I was like "ラキー~~♥♥♥" (Lucky!) when I was at Kinokuniya when A Random Walk Down Wall Street (a book that I had been keeping an eye on as my extra "textbook" reading for stock investment) was featured as Gem of the Month (= 25% discount) in paperback version (= cheaper :p) and found out that Osho's book was on a 20% discount (which I'm fully willing to pay full price for this newly released book). So yay! :D<br /><br />But that also means that I have a full six books to read, on top of my current endeavors to research (i.e. read) stuff for work. (TT_TT)|| But I'll manage! :D{%- endmark %}
