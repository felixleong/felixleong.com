What can I do for you?

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?

あの日ココロの彼方に 描いてた場所にいる
途方に暮れでたりする けれどもう戻れない

夢に見たカタチとは
なにもかもが違う
現実には…眩暈さえする

リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
負けたくない
もうただ走るしかないこの胸に
聞こえてくる
キミは一人じゃない

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?

決して振り向きはしない あなたには頼らない
なにかがあれば必ず すぐに来てくれるから

いまぼくにできること
それは信じること…
真実なら この胸にある

リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
支えるのは
そうあなたが教えてくれたすべて
いまの私
だから、一人じゃない

What can I do for you?
I can hear you

リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
感じても
あなたが目を閉じたならそこにいる
絆がある
だから、一人じゃない

リアルな世界に揺れてる感情
負けたくない
もうただ走るしかないこの胸に
聞こえてくる
キミは一人じゃない

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?
I can hear you

<em>English Translation</em>
[from <a href="http://www.animelyrics.com/jpop/kodakumi/realemotion.jis">Anime Lyrics</a>]

What can I do for you?

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?

I pictured myself somewhere far in my heart that day
It becomes dark in the distance, but I can no longer return

The shape I saw in my dream
Is different from everything
I become dizzy from reality

The feeling of swaying in the real world
I don't want to lose
The only thing I can hear from my heart is
to run.
You are not alone

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?

I won't turn back, I won't rely on you
Because if something happens, you'll always come to me quickly

The only thing I can do now
is to believe…
The truth is in my heart

The feeling of swaying in the real world
Holds me up
You taught me everything I know
That is me now
So, I am not alone

What can I do for you?
I can hear you

The feeling of swaying in the real world
Even if you feel it
If you close your eyes, I will be there
There is a bond between us
So, you are not alone

The feeling of swaying in the real world
I don't want to lose
The only thing I can hear from my heart is
to run.
You are not alone

What can I do for you?
I can hear you
What can I do for you?
I can hear you{%- endmark %}
