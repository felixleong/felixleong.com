{% mark post -%}Yesterday&apos;s recap:
- Still having some bumpy rides with my work as I&apos;m still learning the in&apos;s and out&apos;s of the job. Still trying to get myself in sync with everything :). (guess that&apos;s what we call "working experience"? :p)

- Won Euromach 1 and The Best of Euromach 2001 from eBay! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; The bad news is that it banged my budget (OK, they are really cheap, but my living expenses doesn&apos;t really have much room for me to spend much on entertainment) But I&apos;m so looking forward to receiving them as I fell in love with the mixing of Euromach 1 (when I bought it for my friend) and the tracklist of Best of Euromach 2001 looks very promising (and with a lot of SCP goodness! :D)

- Aunt Maggie came for a visit today and she have brought a Japanese friend over as she was visiting Malaysia. She is very kind and soft lady with a very fair complexion which doesn&apos;t really shows any signs of age. She can&apos;t speak English very well though, and she used her electronic dictionary off and on to communicate with us. But apparently I do get a chance to talk to her in Japanese, but like her, I have to rely on my paperback Japanese dictionary. Guess my vocabulary does need a lot of practice before I can do strike any interesting conversation in Japanese. But basically it&apos;s a good experience to me. :)

- Just finished reading Zen and Japanese Culture today. I&apos;m still thinking what book that I wanted to read next, currently it&apos;s really among The Leader In You by Dale Carnegie, the Chinese novelisation of Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and a bunch of classic fictions (Huck Finn, Black Beauty, Gulliver&apos;s Travels etc.). Hmm…. But honestly speaking, I really wonder whether I need a least some basic understanding about Christianity in order to make sense of Paradise Lost?

- The 6th Harry Potter book is going to be out soon *_*. I don&apos;t plan to buy it soon as I&apos;m planning to get the paperback version, but GAH I need some way to avoid from any spoilers when it does get released!{%- endmark %}
