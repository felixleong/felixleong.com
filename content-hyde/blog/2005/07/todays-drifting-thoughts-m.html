{% mark post -%}A lot of things happen around me when I&apos;m unaware. I doesn&apos;t involve me but then seeing the things revolving around the closest people concerns me.

A time when you&apos;ll get to see that your surrounding good or bad, bubbles up and burst in front of your eyes. Uncertainty and constant change happens every single day. A dream attained can get burst like a bubble, and yet the agony of emotional torture can also be blown away by a calming breeze.

From time to time, I seem to fidget with unease… is it fear? Anxiety? Excitement? Bliss?

Closing my eyes, everything comes and goes. Reflecting back on myself, all clinging seems to me like a fear in disguise. How much certain I am that I&apos;ll still have the things I have… and for how long?

What is the meaning of life to you? What is the purpose of living your life now? What is the greatest treasure in your own heart…?

…

It really reminds me of Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s M, as the meaning of the lyrics still resonates in my heart…

[:: Unrelated note ::]
As a bad habit, I have the tendency to "flex" my glasses, and to my shock this morning, I accidently bent it right in the middle O_O||. Luckily that it didn&apos;t break, but as I try to bend it back in shape, I&apos;m really afraid that I&apos;ll really break it (= that I have to buy a new pair of glasses = $$$ outflow).

Now I&apos;m still getting used to this "new" old pair of glasses as I feel as if the weight distribution on my nose feels different.

Reminder to self: Take GOOD care with my glasses!{%- endmark %}
