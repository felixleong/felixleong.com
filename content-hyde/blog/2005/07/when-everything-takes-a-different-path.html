{% mark post -%}Despite having my muscles feeling a little bit cramped today, I went for MIND (Malaysian Independent Developers, also known as Malaysian Independent .NET Developers) meeting today. And boy talk about a low turnout today :(, it&apos;s like… it used to be at least a half-full, now it&apos;s like the head count takes room less than a quarter of the usual auditorium). I wonder why…?

Anyway, I&apos;m just surprised to meet some of my university mates there. Manage to catch up with them for a while, however the disappointing part is that all conversations just scratched the mere surface and nothing deeper. I don&apos;t know, probably it&apos;s because now people treated me like a working professional instead of what they use to treat me when I&apos;m still a university student? Or probably I have changed in some subtle ways? Truth to be told though, now at my current position, it just seems as if my perspective has changed somehow. Hmmm…

That aside, I did believe that I made some minor communication and courtesy blunders, but ah~ I suppose that&apos;s part of the learning experience ^^". However I&apos;m pretty glad how I manage to handle the social situations today as I find myself finding less difficulty in speaking my mind out, which is a good sign.

As an unrelated note, I&apos;m starting to fill in the gaps for PPP2. I&apos;m glad that there&apos;s only three spots for me to fill in this time ;) (Compared to PPP3-7, in which I haven&apos;t learn even half of the tracklists XD), and so today I learnt Shadows In The Night / Princess F, and w00t! I love this song a lot! :D I am considering to buying it of from @music soon :).{%- endmark %}
