{% mark post -%}My Euromach CDs just came into the mail today :D! OK, maybe not from the mail directly but I just went to the post office to collect it this morning. And The Best of Euromach 2001 has awesome non-stop remixing goodness &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;! And of course finally I got a copy of Euromach 1 (which I really wanted it so badly)!

And to my surprise I manage to keep my hands on the keyboard while listening to these CDs during work :p (instead of making Parapara gestures XDDDD).

Rewinds things back to yesterday and the day before, nothing much happened except the fact that I&apos;m getting really fatigued physically for the past two days x_x. But I&apos;m in good condition now after a really good sleep :).

Other than that… things are getting busy over here lately :), going back to Kuala Kangsar (my hometown) tommorrow! (Yay! Paradise!){%- endmark %}
