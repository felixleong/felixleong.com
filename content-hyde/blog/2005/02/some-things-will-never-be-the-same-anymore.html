<hr />

All I wanted to say is… I&apos;ll always be the same deep down, but there&apos;re some things that will never be the same anymore.

On a light note, I dyed my hair again. This time to golden ash. This time round I do the Gatsby Xtreme Colouring where it involves the two step process where you have to use their EX-High bleach to bleach your hair to a extremely light brown colour (more like yellow to me), then later on use their bleach colours of choice.

Honestly speaking… well… for my first attempt to dye my hair to a much lighter colour this time round, I consider it more as a blunder. OK, first step, the bleaching part, I&apos;m extremely happy when I finally got my hair to have a much orange-y brown colour (Somewhat I do feel like I&apos;m Kyou in Fruitsbasket :p), but only to realise later that the nape and the hairs behind my ears aren&apos;t dyed at all >.<". So it&apos;s like… the most parts of the hair is brownish but with tints of black, together with a big patch of black at the back of it. Meh… ;___;

Then later on, I put on the golden ash dye… but it seems that the final results wasn&apos;t that satisfying in the end. (well… perhaps not under flourescent light…) It looks more or less the same colour I used to have, only lighter with some *extremely* light gold tint. ;___;

Oh well… probably I will get another bottle of EX-Hi Bleach next month :p.

Before this…

Obviously I have been tweaking with the colours via software. But only brightness and contrast adjustments only :).
