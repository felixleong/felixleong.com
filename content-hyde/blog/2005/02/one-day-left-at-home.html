{% mark post -%}Just a shortie. I&apos;ll post details later.

- Chinese New Year is really fun ^^.
- Friends, Mahjong and sleepless nights :p
- Won SEB80 and 90, w00tage! :D
- The battery compartment of my digital camera is spoilt T-T. Which means now I can&apos;t have the battery compartment closed without having rubber bands stranded to my camera >o<". Thinking of claiming a warranty once I go back to my aunt&apos;s place.
- My new look got a lot of attention and jaw drops XD.
- Extremely high sex drive is torturing me :p

I think I&apos;ll stop here now. Post more tommorrow or so.{%- endmark %}
