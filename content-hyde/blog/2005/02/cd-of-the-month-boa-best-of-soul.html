{% mark post -%}Just got myself BoA&apos;s BEST OF SOUL album ^^b. Anyway, here&apos;s a first impression review of the album:

<b>BoA BEST OF SOUL</b> <first Impression Review>
Artist: Boa
<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/albums/boa_bos.jpg">
First of all, I have to say that I haven&apos;t listened to BoA before, as much as most of my friends recommend her music to me. I have been a little bit reserved beforehand because judging at her current number of albums (around 7, I believe, including her Korean albums).

But it&apos;s really exciting when she decided to have her best collection out, which has released this month. Now, the reason of getting this album a little bit early is because the first pressing, i.e. Perfect Edition, contains a limited edition DVD which contains all the MVs of her songs (excluding Kono Yono Shirushi [lit. The Mark of This World]). And as a tradition of BoA albums, you always have to expect some bonus tracks, in which the CD contains a cover of LA.LA.LA LOVE SONG (yes, it&apos;s the theme song of one of the popular J-Dramas, Long Vacation, if I&apos;m not mistaken), and the DVD contains 2 making of… videos together with the Love Bug, a collaboration with m-flo.

OK, as a first time listener to BoA and a pretty avid listener to JPop (well… although technically BoA is a Korean :p), honestly first impression wise is that I&apos;m totally caught off guard. Well, the reason why I say so is that most of her music, especially the dance tracks, sounds very American/Western. Surprise, surprise. Although there are quite some slower ballads (which does sound more JPop-ish), the whole album is mainly dominated by dance tracks which has a much stronger western influence. So it&apos;s best to not to treat it as a JPop CD or else you&apos;ll find yourself struggling to fully enjoy this CD (like what happen to me during the first few tracks of the CD :p). And as a best collection, the tracklist is pretty solid, with the power of the whole album builds up until the end of album, with a very climatic Meri Kuri (lit. Merry Christmas), leaving a strong punch to the whole experience. Then later on, the refreshing LA LA LA LOVE SONG serves as a good dessert to make this album extremely enjoyable. If there&apos;s anything to nitpick, I would say that I can&apos;t seem to find a song which leaves an extremely deep impression except for Meri Kuri, and the others could probably need a few listens before I can remember them.

As a bottomline, for those who are into Western pop and dance music, you would find this album extremely appealing, and it should be considered as a good album to start with if you are planning to try to get yourself into JPop. And for JPop fans who haven&apos;t listen to BoA before, you shouldn&apos;t find it hard to enjoy the album since her vocals, music and style are pretty similar to Utada Hikaru and Namie Amuro.

And all BoA fans shouldn&apos;t be missing this album since it contains a cool DVD which shows off BoA&apos;s talent in dancing and *squee* her flowing hair (reminds me of shampoo&apos;s commercials :p). So for such a solid album with a bonus, coolish DVD, it&apos;s definitely worth the price of the album itself (although it&apos;s sliiightly on the expensive side, IMHO).
