{% mark post -%}Well… I&apos;m almost finished packing for tommorrow. Just need to copy some critical files from my compie then I should be OK.

Honestly speaking… as much as I really liked to go home, but my heart seems a bit heavy to leave as well… God… I haven&apos;t leave yet and yet I&apos;m missing people now ;____;. But thinking about it, most of my friends are already back in their hometown for Chinese New Year celebrations and being here wouldn&apos;t help much… meh… ;____;.

At times like this, I do wonder whether my whole makeover thing is really worth it… am I afraid that I&apos;m starting to lose my self identity? Or is it that nobody really cared anyway? … but thinking about it guess I&apos;m just too self-conscious/sensitive with low esteem. Apprehension… no wonder change is kinda scary, it&apos;s really like… once you board that ship, you&apos;ll never know whether you&apos;ll be able to go back to where you were before… It may be good, or it&apos;ll bad… nobody knows.

…

Just all of a sudden, two words sudden came to mind… like a small voice whispering through my ears: "Be here". Somewhat it seems to carry a really deep meaning in between, it&apos;s more or less like "Live the moment", but by my perspective, they are seems to be a bit different for some reasons. More or less, it just came to me like it means "Don&apos;t worry what will happen next, just be here: perform the act in totality. Just focus on what you need to do, and let us do the rest for you."

I believed that the gift to humans is the ability to choose: to choose whichever path and lifestyle they decide to live with. Guess I just have to take a deep breath and be strong…

[p/s: I&apos;ll try to do my daily updates when I&apos;m back home ^^]{%- endmark %}
