{% mark post -%}One midterm down, two more to go…

Feeling pretty sickly today ;_;. Well… I haven&apos;t fallen sick yet, but from my current physical condition, if I don&apos;t rest and drink lots of water, I bound to be sick pretty soon.

Bleh… hope the weather gets better… or maybe I should bring a water bottle out next time instead. The blazing heat is no where from making me any healthier.{%- endmark %}
