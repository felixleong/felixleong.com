<hr />

Finally I get to get my final touch for my CNY clothes set :): The shoes! :D Anyway, there&apos;s a warehouse sale just next to my house and I just got a pair of maroon coloured shoes. It looks pretty retro and maroon isn&apos;t the easiest colour to match, so actually I am a bit worried. But to my surprise, it matches the pants :D.

And so that pretty much ends my hunt to finish my clothes shopping (well… if I don&apos;t end it now, I guess most probably I&apos;ll end up getting other stuffs like a watch, a matching backpack, a pouch, accessories… bla bla bla, and most probably I&apos;ll bang my budget again in no time ^^")

Anyway, been playing truant these few days so that I can spend more time at home working on the things that needs to be done. Hopefully I can get my final year project done… >.>

To wrap this up…

Somehow I wished I had a camera man instead of having to have myself second guessing everything :p{%- endmark %}
