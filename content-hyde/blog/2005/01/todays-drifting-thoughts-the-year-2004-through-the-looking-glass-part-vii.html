{% mark post -%}It&apos;s been a while that I haven&apos;t did this, and there&apos;s another 6 left pending in my queue… Honestly I don&apos;t know, probably because the events are too recent that I would like to let them sink in for a while. But judging the fact that 7 is my lucky number, well, I might as well do with some distraction before I napped… AGAIN.

<b>July 2004 -- I&apos;ve Been Seeing Cherry Blossom&apos;s Blooming</b>

Ah July! :D The most stressful (midterms, assignments and what nots), yet the most happiest month I had over 2004 :), not to mention that I was being quite thoughtful in July as well.

Honestly pretty much I was being pretty social in July actually, thanks to the fact that I knew Choon Hui and Erika better during that time. So pretty much every single day in July is extremely meaningful to me, just a lot of happy and positive thoughts and energy seems to flow into me. The laughter, the fun and the heartbeats… they seems to flow in me until now… ^^

Reading through the longer entries that I had… it just seems that all my drifting thoughts that I have collected all the while means a lot to me actually, for these small little fragment thoughts and inquries, in a way, slowly forms my own views and principles in life. Seeing that, I believe these deep thoughts I had in July play an extremely important role in forming my future. Well… at least something tells me that they are important.

So by that, I can pretty much say that the most prominent month that pretty much represents 2004 is probably July, as it signifies the beginning in a lot of aspects.{%- endmark %}
