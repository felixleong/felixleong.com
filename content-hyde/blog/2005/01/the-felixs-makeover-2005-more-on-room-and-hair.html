{% mark post -%}I wonder whether I&apos;m starting to get the kicks or am I starting to be just plain crazy, I&apos;m starting to get find this makeover thingy more and more fun, perhaps to a point in which I find really addictive :p.

For today, just around noontime when I woke up, I straight away took my broom and mop and cleaned up and rearranged some stuff in my room, and now my study table and bed portion of the room looks extremely neat and tidy, not to mention sparkling clean now :3. Now I still need to clear up the mess on my bookshelf, the closet, my computer table in the hall, and start to take out some of those recyclable materials that I have accumulated until now. Bwee~

But somehow now I&apos;m all alone to do the hairstyling, I&apos;m a complete idiot in doing that. I really wondered how the hairstylist can do it in so fast with style while I&apos;m fumbling with my hair for an hour and still can&apos;t get the desired effect I wanted :(.

Later on in the afternoon I went out, and grabbed a copy of Dream Come True&apos;s The Monster universal mix in the bargain bin (as most of you know, I&apos;m starting the venture Jpop stuff… well, although the album is a English release). Originally I was only thinking of getting a stronger hair gel in the pharmacy just now, however passing through the Gatsby section… just out of the blue, the kicks seems to influence me and I got the Gatsby hairwax and a pack of hair bleach instead. And god they weren&apos;t really cheap… well… still considered reasonable though (less money to spend on clothes now ;___;).

And now instead of having jetblack hair now, it has been bleached to some sort of a dark golden brown colour now. But with my current hairstyle where all my hair isn&apos;t combed together, it&apos;s not really that obvious, really. And I really <333 hairwax now :), personally I really like the fact that it can set the hair with ease and much flexibility without leaving a really sticky sensation on the hair (that&apos;s pretty much the reason why I always hated hairgels and prefered the natural touch).

And not to mention that I can style my hair with ease now. W00tage! :D

Oh yeah, new pics! :D
[:: Edit: Crap I always forgot to put the photos up before I do the posting XDDD ::]

This one is the same with the glasses, the old pair anyway (since I have to wait another 4 days for the new pair){%- endmark %}
