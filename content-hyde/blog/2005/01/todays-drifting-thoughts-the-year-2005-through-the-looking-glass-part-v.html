May is pretty much like a shopping spree month for me, seeing how many things I have bought on that month itself. Yeah… Reminded me that that month is the time when I got my first installment of my loan money. That… pretty much reflects how bad my spending habits were.

For the first time I ever get robbed, honestly that was the most scariest incident I had up until now. I can still remember how panic I were and Allen have to go through all my incoherent talking ^^". Luckily my parents are really supportive that really helps a lot.

Other than that… honestly speaking, it&apos;s pretty much a shallow month for me, considering most happenings are much more materialistic in nature. But I suppose that does mask away my depression for the time being? *shrugs* Honestly I can&apos;t think of much that reminds me of May actually.

Anyway, the interesting stuff is picking up in June ^^.

OK, just grabbed Christine&apos;s Wings Into The Sky off from Ahmed&apos;s folder (again :p). [to Ahmed, hope you don&apos;t mind me digging through your folder] And hmmm~ It really sounds interesting, because somewhat it didn&apos;t sound anywhere close to being Eurobeat at all (except for the song structure). But I really like how the song turns out, it&apos;s like… a cross of… say, oriental, new age and Eurobeat. As the song starts, it seems to unfold into a really broad horizon. Great song :).

I would love to choreo a para for it, but my initial attempts doesn&apos;t seem to work out. Gah~ hard songs to choreo :p.

Currently I feeling a bit… unenthusiatic, I suppose, it seems that I can&apos;t get motivated enough to start my programming for my final year project >.<". Hmm…{%- endmark %}
