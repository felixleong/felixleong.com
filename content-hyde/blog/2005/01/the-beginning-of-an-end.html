{% mark post -%}School starts! :D

So yeah I finally get to come back to school at last ;). As much as I&apos;m excited about it, it really hope that it&apos;ll not end soon… because this semester will be my last in this University. :( Lots of good memories, guess I have to treasure every single moment I had left.

The classes are pretty boring actually, but I&apos;m more glad to see my friends around :3.

Been getting quite some attention with my new hair :3, and I really enjoyed my new look. Other than that… Well… I&apos;m feeling a little bit emotional today in a subtle manner. It&apos;s really hard for me to express how I&apos;m feeling, but all I can say that it&apos;s pretty positive ;).

Anyway, wish me luck throughout this semester.{%- endmark %}
