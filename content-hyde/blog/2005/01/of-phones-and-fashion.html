{% mark post -%}All the while I have been complaining that my phone is getting a bit wonky sometimes, so I decided to go to the service centre and get that fixed. Luckily it was done promptly. Hopefully it&apos;ll solve the problem or I would need to go to there again :(.

Initially I was thinking of buying the two sets of new clothings for Chinese New Year, but I can&apos;t seem to know which one suits me better so I&apos;m thinking of delaying it later so that I can pick them up with Erika, or probably with some other girls if she can&apos;t make it (hopefully, since she is responsible for picking my specs :) ). But then again, I don&apos;t think I know many girl friends in my university.

I&apos;m not really decided yet, but I&apos;m thinking of using the fire and ice concept for this year. Which means that I would get two totally contrasting sets of clothes, the fire set would be a much more daring, breaking out of my traditional clothes, funky style; while the ice set would be much more focused on maturity, or probably the calmer side of myself without sacrificing any style factor.

Currently I&apos;m thinking of getting:
- Long sleeves shirt, probably white or plain coloured
- Matching tees or shirt to go with it
- One set of jeans, but probably traditional ones but with cool cuttings and fabric (I personally don&apos;t really like washed out colours or any flashy patches on it, because it would be hard to match them with)
- And one long pants like Kyou (Fruitbasket :p) had, with two straps dangling on each side. I saw one on Shibuya fashion store :3.

Probably I would go for this <font color=#f9066d><strong>red (for fire) </strong></font>and this <font color=#48e405><strong>green (for ice)</strong></font> [sorry because I really sucked in colour names XDDD]. I really like this ones that Giodarno shows in one of their posters, but I was wondering whether I would want to pick that combo because probably most people would have stole that idea in the first place :p.

I&apos;m currently aiming on a below RM250 budget, which is pretty muchâ€¦ well, a tall order since usually long sleeves shirt and the pants would really cost a lot. But then again my parents would scream if they know that I spent more than that for clothes ^^".

Anyway, do expect a Felix Makeover 2005 post once I&apos;m done with the shopping ^^. Cause I&apos;ll totally make sure that I&apos;ll break my usual fashion code ;). (and I would ask my friend to make sure that they are sexy before they EVER approve them ;p)
