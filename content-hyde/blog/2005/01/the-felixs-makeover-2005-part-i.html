{% mark post -%}Bwee~ The outing is really fun today ^^.

Anyway, we have quite a lot of fun today, and "Meet The Fockers" is really an enjoyable movie, I really enjoyed and laughed myself silly from beginning to the end. Personally I didn&apos;t watch the first movie "Meet The Parents", but it good to see it able to stand on its own. I really don&apos;t know whether I should laugh or cry with the censorship board though, for laughs I personally don&apos;t know why they put a "U" (suitable for general public) rating for this movie, seeing that there&apos;s really *quite* (OK, maybe NOT JUST quite) a lot of sexual jokes here and there (well, as much I would say that everything isn&apos;t done explicitly), but I really wanted to cry because some of the stronger punchline and gags has been snipped off by our censorship board ;____;. I really wanted to know what parts that I have missed out in the first place.

Anyway, just to give it a kickstart, I decided to give myself a small makeover :3. So before I left I tidied up my study table (which used to be an absolute mess, refer to the picture below), and when I went to Midvalley, I give myself a new hairstyle and a new pair of specs. Wellâ€¦ honestly I have to wait 5 more days to get my specs done, so no pictures of that ;p. But I DO took a picture of myself~ Look~ :3

Freshly cut and styled~ :D

Sorted out my table as well ^^

Anyway, personally I would see it as a good thing because this is the first time I actually go out an get myself a new hairstyle ^^. Will take pictures once I got my specs.

As a sidenote, I NEVER expect I have to spend that much for a makeover. >.<" But then again, I suppose it&apos;s pretty much due the higher inital cost. Probably I won&apos;t be getting a lot of clothes, since I don&apos;t think I have that much money to change my waredrobe completely. But I suppose 2 sets of clothing should give a good start for Chinese New Year :), seeing that my last year&apos;s clothes selection is improving :) (I <333 my sexy jeans).

Anyway, I think I&apos;m thinking of gradually changing my image for 2005. So I&apos;ll be posting any new changes when it comes :).{%- endmark %}
