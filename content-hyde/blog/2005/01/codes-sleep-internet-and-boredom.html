{% mark post -%}Yeah, my day pretty much consist of these four things. But most of time spent is on the ZZZ&apos;s so yeah that is a really bad sign >.>

Somehow I seem to pick FF6 back up again. Ah nostalgia! <:3

Other than thatâ€¦ I&apos;m working on my codes now, *probably* I can get some algorithms done in a few days.

Now all I need is to get rid of my forum and sleep addiction or else I&apos;ll be dead meat.{%- endmark %}
