{% mark post -%}零碎的思绪中，好像一切都毫无秩序：
- 突然而来的感觉，让我换了另一个角度。
- 无需刻意寻找，幸福就在已身边。
- 一切变化无常，有时让我看不清楚。
- 追逐梦想很重要，但停顿休息也不能忽略。
- 在这不平稳的舞台上，也不能放弃生命的舞蹈。
- 扫去心中的那层尘埃，才发现到你眼神中的那份灿烂。原来让我看不清楚的是我自己。
- 一切变化无常，却让我体会到真实不变的存在。
- 才发现，变的，不是身边的一切，而是自己的角度。

静下来想一想，原来一直寻找的答案，就已经隐蕴在心中。

Within my fragmented thoughts, it seems like everything is out of order:
- A feeling that suddenly came to me, (has) let me changed another perspective.
- Even without pursing purposely, happiness is already by your side.
- Everything changes, sometimes make me unable to see clearly.
- Pursuing dreams is important, but don&apos;t neglect oneself to stop and rest.
- Even on this unsteady dance floor, one should not stop the dance of life.
- Dusting off my heart, then I only notice the colours in your eyes. Only I realised that what really blinded me is my own self.
- Everthing changes, but that makes me understand the existence of an unchanging reality.
- Only I noticed, that what really changed, is not the things around me, but my own perspective.

Thinking in a moment of silence, I realised that the answers that I search for, already lies deep within.{%- endmark %}
