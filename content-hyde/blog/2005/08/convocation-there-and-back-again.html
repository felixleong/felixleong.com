{% mark post -%}I don&apos;t know whether I should say that there&apos;s a lot of things happened then… ironic as it sounds that nothing much really happened when I looked back at the events itself. But nonetheless it does gave me some emotional impact (refer to my previous post for my condensed thoughts of it).

Anyway, just get the tapes of memories rewinded and summarised…

Friday has been a very exciting day for me as I anticipated the arrival of my family (except for my sister). However, what I didn&apos;t anticipate is that something may go wrong in the process… and it did happened as things goes slightly wrong with my brother. As I heard from him, he is caught in the middle of nowhere when the bus which my brother is suppose to board on sped away without even waiting for my brother to board on the bus (and my brother is very punctual)! Apparently the bus driver isn&apos;t in a good mood. In the end, my brother has to beg the other bus drivers to get him here. It really put me into a worry drive and apparently I&apos;m losing all my focus. But luckily he did made it.

My family and I spent the night together with Aunt Ling, and we do share a very good time together. And finally I get to see Boxer, Aunt Ling&apos;s new dog! But the excitement fades off pretty quickly as it treated me in an indifferent manner. :/ Somehow his behaviour does resembles myself in one way or the other. And we get to talk a lot until late at night.

The convocation itself was a success :). Although graduating from the university should be the most exciting thing in my own life, but the main highlight of the day in my own personal opinion is to meet up with friends, congratulating them and taking tons of photographs :p. But that itself is a very challenging task as we have to find them in the sea of people gathering outside the hall @_@. But nonetheless I manage to take photographs with all my close friends :).

And after the convocation ceremony, I get to attend the press conference and I represented my course to be interviewed :). The thought flattered me until I saw the papers the next day as one of the Chinese dailies summarise my thoughts into a biased comment with marketing hype towards the interest of the university, a very embarrassing group photo shoot that goes with the special feature (the shot showed me sticking out my tongue when I joked with my friend ^^". Moral of the story: Don&apos;t try to be funny when there are cameras in front of you). One English paper only quoted me in one line, but I have to say that was definitely a gem as the line being quoted is <i>"Technically speaking, I am a geek."</i> XDDDD And one friend told me that I made on the front page with me talking on my mobile when my mom calls me at the most inappropriate moment.

My parents left halfway through the proceeding as they have to take an early bus back home. And so I went shopping with my brother after the convocation. And surprisingly, I didn&apos;t expect to find a lot of JPop CDs in the budget corner when I was there <333. They are mostly from EMI, and it&apos;s a really good chance for me to expand my Jpop horizon :). I basically got an album from Shizuka Kodo, Yuming, Miki Imai, Sakura and globe (the only avex album I can grab there).

Then Sunday came and my brother took an early bus back as well as he has work to do back there. Although it&apos;s really a pity to see him go this early, but I&apos;m very glad and proud for my brother as he is actively involved in various academic activities in his university. And just soon after Aunt Ling sent both of us home, I go out again to attend my friends&apos; convocation. And that means more merry making and photographs :p. The greatest regret has to not being able to get a snapshot of Choon Hui in his gown. But getting to meet some long-lost friends there makes up for that disappointment.

And later on I went out karaoke&apos;ing with Raymond and the gang until midnight. And the price of fun is that I ended up totally tired at work x_x.

And so that pretty much sums up the events in the past three days.

Speaking of which, I just decided to call my mobile phone posts "Impromptu", which can be seen as "Today Drifting Thoughts" in peanut-sized chunks (since typing entries on a mobile phone keypad can be very tiring).{%- endmark %}
