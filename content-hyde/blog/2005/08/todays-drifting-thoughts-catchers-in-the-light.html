{% mark post -%}1. 虽然说若不争取自己想要的东西，就永远都得不到，但是…自己渴望的东西总是要顾虑到很多人的立场，不能凭任性与自私的心态盲目追求。

是懦弱吗…？是胆小吗…？但是我真的是不想做出无谓的伤害与牺牲，若是自己受伤还无所谓…

…在感情的泛滥当时，我还不容易…把心中那个盖子关起来…

说到底我只是在欺骗着自己…

2. 心中那朦胧的天气，总是带来那pH少过7的味道…还真的是希望一场泪雨可以让阳光灿烂的发光…但是想想看，那只是治标不治本吧？

或许应该告诉自己：请不要在心中乱烧垃圾。

1. Although they say that if you don&apos;t sieze the things that you desired, you&apos;ll never be able to get it forever, but… what I desired for is something that requires consideration of the situation and stand of a lot of different people, and it cannot be pursued blindly with selfish whims.

Is this weakness…? Or is it timidity…? But I really don&apos;t want to make any unneccessary harm and sacrifices, it&apos;s OK if I&apos;m the one who bears the pain…

… At times when my feelings overflows, it takes me much effort… to close the lid of my heart…

That being said, I&apos;m just cheating myself…

2. That hazy weather inside, brings the feeling that has a pH less than 7… And I really hope that a rain of tears will let the sun shine through vibrantly… But thinking about it, maybe that&apos;s only a stopgap measure?

Maybe I should tell myself: Don&apos;t burn more rubbish deep inside.{%- endmark %}
