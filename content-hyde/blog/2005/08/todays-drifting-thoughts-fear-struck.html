{% mark post -%}Bit by bit, I&apos;m still learning how to cope with what I thought was habits in the past. Little that I knew that these are merely traits that reflects back on my own fears, insecurities, anxiety and worries… Fear that I don&apos;t get accepted, fear that I&apos;m unable to get what I wanted, fear that I&apos;m unable to achieve what I expected, fear that everything will be taken away from me, fear that I&apos;m not worthy enough… Each and every time, I constantly find myself shrinking back timidly.

Only that I knew that it&apos;s really not something that can be modified or repressed: It&apos;s completely impossible to do so, because these traits are part of my own defence mechanism. Only that I knew that to cure these traits is to understand what fear is.

… Guess I still need some time and practice to get this right…{%- endmark %}
