{% mark post -%}Let&apos;s see… I have been spending my time back at home yesterday so actually nothing special happened. But just to recap some of the non-serious (or probably trivial) stuff:

Got my hair dyed again, this time I decided to switch to Revlon&apos;s Colour Silk for a change, and guess what colour I chose? :) Strawberry blone! OK, it&apos;s kinda impossible for my dark asian hair (OK, probably I should have said black instead XD), but it still manage to give a really light reddish brown tone to my hair, which is really cool <333 (besides, I personally don&apos;t think that blone really suits my Asian look ;) ). The only thing is that the reddish hue only shows under bright lighting conditions and it&apos;ll still look like brownish Asian hair indoors But oooh~ Reddish hair, makes me feel like Adol in Ys~ :)

And speaking about it, personally I feel that Revlon&apos;s Colour Silk series is much less damaging to the hair than Gatsby&apos;s, and I really love the after colour conditioner that comes with the package. The reason why is that after using it it really makes the hair feels so soft and smooth <333. I wonder whether I can buy that one off the shelf at a reasonable price. But for now I still have to bear with the dryish hair :(.

As for other things, my day isn&apos;t really productive as I find myself lazing around back at home. But I manage to install Linux in my old machine, and the fun part is definitely getting FF7 and 8 PC installed :). Yay for Final Fantasy goodness. The only quirk I had is that both Final Fantasy games are REALLY hardware driver and DirectX version specific X(. This has definitely spoil some of the fun in the games as some graphic effects have to be sacrificed if these strict requirements aren&apos;t met. FF7 is much less of a problem since I got my old computer custom built to play it, but FF8 is DEFINITELY a pain as my new Radeon card screw the whole menu up. So I ended up using the software rendering option and bear with the pixelated textures. Yeesh…

Just to add the fun to it, I also installed the PC version of Guilty Gear X. So yeah now I have REAL games in my PC ;P.

As for my emotional well-being, currently I&apos;m feeling much better now. Currently I&apos;m still adjusting myself to everything.

Just before I end this, my brother&apos;s birthday is yesterday, and by that, he&apos;s already 21 years old now! :) Happy birthday bro! :D

Guess that&apos;s about it!

Currently I&apos;m thinking of putting up friends-only exclusive content. Well, I&apos;ll still keep my main content up as public, but I do feel like posting some random, more personal stuff (*ahem*) private. (And no, it only has an at most PG rating :p) So if you feel that you would want to have a peek at those, or probably you want to know me better as a friend, just comment here so that I can add you into my friends-list :).{%- endmark %}
