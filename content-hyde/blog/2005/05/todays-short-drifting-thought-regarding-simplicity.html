{% mark post -%}It just came to me that sometimes we tend to put tons of unnecessary layers of complexity on top of what seems to be extremely simple and pure. Once that happens, we started to wonder whether it&apos;s the very same thing anymore.

Sometimes humans are just weird in some ways, probably due to the fact that we tend to take things for granted. And at the fact that we do have the tendency to think that our ego is our identity but in actual fact, our ego is probably the very thing that hides our true identity.

It&apos;s only until something happens and all these false layers falls apart that we realise the most important and beautiful core of it.
