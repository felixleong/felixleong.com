{% mark post -%}Somehow by some unexpected turn of events, I consider myself very fortunate to get hold of Chi (aka SeraphicLaw in RPGamer message board, or drifting_floe in LJ). From the people I have known from the Internet, he's probably one of the kindest and most soft-spoken friend that I had. He used to be very active online before he suddenly disappeared from the Internet in general. …Although "disappear" is not a good word to use, considering that he did made an announcement about it. But somehow we didn't expect him not showing up in the Internet for so long -- about three years, to be exact.

Guess that he did manage to pull the plug off, a sign of self control that I really admire him for.

Coming back, it's really great to hear him after his long absence. Really missed all the kind words of encouragement, especially at cloudy times.

As much as I didn't know what happened to him in the past, but I'm sure that he's doing all right :). Wishing all the best in life for him :).

…

In other news, Sze Hau and Sook Lan are going to Korea tomorrow for a week. As much they aren't leaving now, somehow I felt a little bit lonely thinking about it. Sounds kinda silly of me, isn't it?

But that aside, I'm really hoping that they will have tons of fun starting from tomorrow :D!{%- endmark %}
