{% mark post -%}It a time when you stand in the middle of nowhere: One leads back where you came from, another probably would lead to a point of no return… and there's no way to know the outcome.

A time when the only fact that you can be 100% sure of is those within yourself, but that itself might also be distorted by your own emotions; and every external fact that can be obtained is only mere perception of your own.

Finding myself standing at this point, it's the best time when weakness and doubt come creeping in… but their calling is no where from invalid from a certain point of view…{%- endmark %}
