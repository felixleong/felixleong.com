{% mark post -%}For those who is wondering what happen during the past two weeks, well… a lot of things happened lately: Internally and externally. It's even hard enough to stuff all my feelings in a just a post or two.

Anyway, here are the major ones that should be of much concern (either to myself or those who are reading this):
- Experience very fluctuating emotions after my last poem post. Although it's not that hard to predict it's still me boiling up all those unresolved issues of the past that seems to need some sort of closure. But somehow I'm starting to see the importance of it, well, in a way, and that seeking closure from within is no simple task. It's really hard to bear a lot of guilt and pain of the past, honestly.

Still learning how to let go of things, as usual. Getting some good progress, so it seems :).

- Unexpected visits from my friends in my hometown. :) It's kinda fun chilling out with them, but most of the time is gathering the latest updates, I guess.

- Went back to my hometown last Thursday till Saturday. My house is going to be renovated soon, so it does seems like my last visit back "home" :(. It's kind of sad, thinking that I have been staying there ever since I was a baby. But it's pretty much my parent decision to this, and that the building has survived close to a century (well, one of wooden planks of the floor board did give way, to be honest)… well…

And for the next few months, we (or at least my parents) will be staying at our uncle's vacant house just a few blocks away from our current home (which has a brand new 7-Eleven downstairs… which is either a good thing or bad, depending how you look at it). And I have been spending more time moving my sister's comic book/manga collection over to the new house. And believe me, books are one of the most heaviest things that you'll find when you move. Phew.

- Then it's SUNDAY (Nuage, anyone? The song seems to sink in too deep than I expected :p), and it's just the perfect day to attend Vivian's (my office friend) wedding :). Almost the whole staff in my department attended to this grand event in Melaka (a neighbouring state to where I'm staying now, also known as the Historic State in Malaysia).

The highlights is definitely the bride and groom (now officially husband and wife, LOL), on-stage karaoke performance from Sze Hau and myself and your typical "alcohol, the mess, and hangovers" scenario. (and no it wasn't me, since I can't drink :p)

- Just received the DREADED study loan repayment statement. UGH! Another financial parameter coming in when I least expected it (or is it that I'm just being ignorant/negligent all this while?). Currently working out on whether it is possible to convert it to a scholarship, but till then, I really need to plan how to shove enough money out before the interest rates hikes high enough to kill me.

- Guess what? I got <strong>unlimited access</strong> to broadband at home :). So that means that I can download whatever I want :D. Well, not really, since the only thing that gives me the adrenalin rush when I'm downloading is software updates XD. But at least I can get/access to more para media :D. Which is a good bonus. Till then, I'm probably thinking of web-camming, since I have a webcam which is now dusting on top of my monitor :p.

- Then just yesterday and today, I got a bad case of food poisoning which turns into a minor case of feverish symptoms later on. I know you don't want to know the details, but I'm much happier because it seems that I'm not getting the very scary visions, thoughts and stuff when I go through the ordeal.

- Just watched Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children today :D. The only thing that I definitely have to rant about is why the Turks become such jokers? (at least Barret is much more explainable) I definitely need to get the DVD… hopefully after I got my shopping list checked off to a much manageable level :X.

OK, that's enough update for anyone to digest :p.{%- endmark %}
