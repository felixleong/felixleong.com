{% mark post -%}虽然生病的时候，会很痛苦，还可能会失去很宝贵的东西，但因如此会让我们一窥真正更宝贵的东西。

还真是有些时候，也要懂得让自己休息一下。:)

Although during sickness, it will make us feel tortured, and it might even cause us to lose something very dear to us, but because of this it'll give us a glimpse of what's even more precious and important to us.

And really, sometimes, we just need to learn to rest ourselves. :){%- endmark %}
