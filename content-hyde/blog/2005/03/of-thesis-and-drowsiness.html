{% mark post -%}<b>FINALLY</b> I got the damn thesis done on time. Supposedly (learn a new adverb today* :p) the due date should be today, but then again: Since my supervisor is an external one, and he is not around physically, and it is required to hand in the required soft copy to him: this deduce to the fact that there&apos;s no way that I&apos;m able to hand it in today. In fact, one of my friend who is under his supervision says that he&apos;ll collect it personally at a later date, which pretty much means that… um… well… actually I don&apos;t have to rush my work :p.

But then again, I&apos;m glad that I manage to finish my thesis work, as much as I would curse the workload, overall I believe that I do learnt a lot while working on it, as much as the developed system falls short from my expectations. I don&apos;t know, hopefully I&apos;m able to score a decent grade for my project.

Speaking of finishing my thesis, I just feel all so relaxed after such a long period of time, it like having one burden off my shoulder. And just right at the time I reached home, I felt so sleepy that I fall into bed almost instantly. And almost after 3 hours of sleep, I woke up with in such a drowsy state that I felt as if I were drunk. Can&apos;t even walk properly and thinking in a clear and concise manner, in fact. (concise enough to conjure the LJ entry though)

Guess that&apos;ll take a while. Probably getting one good drink from the store to reward myself. But definitely not alcohol :p.

[:: Note ::]
* OK, not really :P. But in the past I mistake it for "Supposively", which is downright wrong :p. Hmm… But then again, guess it&apos;s not late to make corrections ;).]{%- endmark %}
