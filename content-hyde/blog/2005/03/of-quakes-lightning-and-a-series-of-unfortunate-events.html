{% mark post -%}For those who aren&apos;t aware, an earthquake strike Sumatra, Indonesia the day before, with the death toll currently standing around 400 (according to today&apos;s papers). Condolences to those unfortunate people :(.

Saying so, there&apos;s no news about a new wave of tsunami striking anywhere, but we do have a really heavy thunderstorm yesterday. And I&apos;m really having some really unfortunate events when I was napping while the thunder struck my compy :(, the SECOND time! Luckily that the hardware spoilt this time is only my on-board display card and my poor modem (i.e. No Internet). But I wonder whether my wishes are being answeredâ€¦ -.-" But at least that gave me a chance to break away from the Internet for a while.

And the worst unfortunate event? I have TWO assignment deadlines this week *dies*. Luckily it&apos;s a group project and my team members are really cooperative. Hopefully everything will be safe :(.

Will be getting a new graphics card later. And my Guilty Gear X OST is being shipped, hopefully to get it soon :).{%- endmark %}
