{% mark post -%}Just went to fill up the job application form today, and I&apos;m just on my first steps in getting the job. Now I need is to send in the required documents, make sure I get my grades right this semester and NOT to screw up for whatever relevant reasons and I&apos;ll be sure of getting the job I wanted.

And just a mental note: Don&apos;t screw up when you get the job as well, it&apos;s definitely going to be good experience down the road ;).

What else, thesis due date tomorrow and I have the final two chapter to type :(. But I do have the materials, hopefully I don&apos;t get a writer&apos;s block or I&apos;m <b>IN DEEP TROUBLE</b>.

What else, yeah! I got move&apos;s BOULDER today and all I can say it will rock your socks off :D! A definitely 5/5 in my books ;).{%- endmark %}
