{% mark post -%}These came into the mail today :)

Kinda disappointed that SEB presents J-Euro Collections are radio edits instead of extended mix (ARGH~ I want the extended mix for Karen&apos;s Nothing&apos;s Gonna Take My Love From You). But anyway, still need to listen them through ^^.

Will be taking another CD collection collage once the last CD get through the mail (J-Euro Collection Vol.1)~

[:: UPDATE ::]
The CDs are great :D. My current favourite track is definitely Something In My House / Dead or Alive (the last track from Super Euro Zip), the song is really spooky, or maybe I just love the lyrics :). But the melody and the vocals are really great in this song. Not to mention that it&apos;s not from the major Eurobeat labels under SEB. A definite choreo from me ^^.

Anyway, the lyrics:

<b>Something In My House / Dead or Alive</b>
[* from Dead Or Alive&apos;s Official Site: http://www.deadoralive.net/index.html]
I am being haunted

I am here all by myself
I am here all by myself
And you&apos;re somewhere else
With someone else

It&apos;s four o&apos;clock in the morning
And I&apos;m sitting on my bed
and there&apos;s banging round the bedroom
Nobody knows there&apos;s no one there

I am here all by myself
and you&apos;re somewhere else
With someone else
I am being haunted
By a love that isn&apos;t there

(Chorus)
There is something in my house
It&apos;s just the ghost of a long
Long dead affair
There is something in my house
I just keep a-hearing you
Runnin&apos; round my stairs
But you&apos;re not there

I really got to hand it to you
You showed me a good time
But for every minute that we&apos;ve spent laughin&apos;

There were hours that I cried
And I&apos;ve
And I&apos;ve never meant that wicked way
But my heart broke into pieces
At midnight
One Hallowe&apos;en

(Chorus)

*Note: Hmm… the song is in Dead or Alive&apos;s Evolution: The Hits, which I believe I saw it in the CD shop I frequent, probably I would want to check that out and put it in my wish list.

Post later ^^.{%- endmark %}
