{% mark post -%}Nothing much except the fact that my revision for combinatronics is practically draining my energy. As much as I loved mathematics, my brain cells doesn&apos;t seem to cope with the sheer complexity of it. But I suppose that only proves the point that I didn&apos;t do too much practice on my mathematics stuff :p.

At least all I need to do is to do more exercises for my exams preparation and I should do good.

Be studying for virtual reality tommorrow! :){%- endmark %}
