{% mark post -%}Yesterday&apos;s steamboat dinner with Dr Tay and the gang is really fun :). We went to a steamboat restaurant called Strangers in SS2 and we had their delicious all-you-can-eat steamboat buffet. Yum! Not to mention I&apos;m pretty much stuffed with all the food and desserts there. <333

Let&apos;s don&apos;t forget the quality time we spent together chatting away :).

Andâ€¦ Pictures! :D It&apos;s only two though since I didn&apos;t get the permission (at least not yet) to post the fun pictures while we are having the steamboat dinner. Sooo~~~
