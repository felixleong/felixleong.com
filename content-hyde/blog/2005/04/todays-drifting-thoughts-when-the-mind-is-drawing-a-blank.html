{% mark post -%}For the past few days, I was really busy going out there doing things, something pretty different from what I usually do actually.

Just to give some sort overview of what&apos;s happening, basically I have been mixing around with more people. Well… technically I wouldn&apos;t say that I know them for the first time, as these people are my class/course mates all the while, but I would say that this is the first time that I actually go out with them. Personally I find this as something different from what I would usually do, but just that I just felt the urge… well, you know, getting to mix around with more people. And to be honest, I think that&apos;s pretty much a welcoming change in terms of my own lifestyle, really.

But somehow I&apos;m having this sort of a funny feeling that I can&apos;t really explain. It&apos;s like… well, thinking about it, I have been in this university for two years already, and as much as I did make friends during my study, I didn&apos;t seem to actually know them personally or actually mix or go out with them. And it&apos;s like… only now, at this point of time when everyone of us will not be together as often as we used to be in university, am I a little bit late to actually mix with them and get to know them personally? Honestly speaking, I wouldn&apos;t say that I really enjoyed myself totally when I mixed around with these friends, in fact I really find myself in an awkward situation. Really, sometimes I really get the feeling of being left out or something as I didn&apos;t seem to be able to participate in the conversation and understand the in-jokes and other stuff.

As much as I understand my own position and I should accept the fact that it&apos;d take a much longer time for me to actually get more engaged with these people, the feeling of isolation can sometimes really overwhelm me that I do feel discouraged to carry on. But thinking about it, I don&apos;t really mind being an outcast of sorts (OK, maybe I do mind as I can&apos;t feel "isolated" if I didn&apos;t) and I would really want to be friends with them instead of just being a mere acquaintance. However as I am saying this, somehow thoughts just came to me as if it were obstacles towards attaining that: That I don&apos;t really able to fit into a group setting of more than 3-4 persons, that there&apos;s some sort of a gap when it comes to interests and hobbies (as in I personally don&apos;t really enjoy some much popular activities such as football/soccer or pop music; and not much people are aware of the things that I do like such as Eurobeat music or perhaps even reading), that I don&apos;t really care much about gossips (since my memory for names is extremely bad and personally I don&apos;t see the purpose of that)… and so on and so forth. As much as I believe that the uniqueness between people is what would make friendship interesting, but then again, it&apos;s 10 times more challenging to get to know our friends better when there aren&apos;t much in common.

Writing up to this point, somehow I am wondering myself though: Even if my intentions to know these people better are genuine and of good intentions, however am I trying too hard to fit in to the point that I&apos;m rushing it? Somehow thinking back, I did find myself indirectly being aggressive in trying to bridge that gap sooner sometimes, I really wondered whether that really intimidated people? Or probably I&apos;m just being impatient to a point that I disillusioned myself?

I think I better stop here as I really wanted to sleep now…

Just before that, a recap of what happened:
- Went to the pub with my classmates at midnight after my last paper
- I finally finished with what&apos;s required for my job, and so I&apos;ll be reporting for work next Tuesday :)
- I got myself a new pair of headphones, as rubber enclosure of the earpiece has fallen off with my old pair and I don&apos;t really find it comfortable to wear it with the cotton wrapping
- Been going out with Raymond and the gang for some Warcraft III: dotA action lately, and boy it was fun :).
- … and the downside of all this is a major cash outflow this week :(.

I&apos;ll be busy today and tomorrow as there&apos;s still things for me to settle. As much the workload for this week is definitely killing me, but it&apos;s all worth it, not to mention that the whole week is packed with a lot of things that I&apos;m looking forward to :). I&apos;ll post updates as soon as it occurs :).{%- endmark %}
