{% mark post -%}My friend, Kok Weng, got called in for the second phase of the interview test in my department today, I would really like to congratulate him for making this far and I&apos;m really happy and proud of him :). I really wish him the best of luck! ;)

My friend, Raymond (and probably Alvin as well), left for Penang yesterday. Hopefully they will be treated well there, as (if I&apos;m not wrong) they left their own homes for the very first time. I hope for the best in their first job as well as a great stay over there.

And as for Choon Hui… I&apos;m really glad that he&apos;s kick starting his own plans in furthering his studies, and he&apos;s currently working on with his IELTS (so that he can study overseas). I&apos;m really glad to see that he&apos;s on his way to achieve excellence, and I sincerely hope that he&apos;ll be able to achieve the best in life.

As for myself, well… my research project is almost done, will be handing it in tomorrow, although I&apos;m not really satisfied with what I did. That gives a good call for me to say goodbye to my own burdens that I have been holding and get my gears all pumped up for the upcoming adventures that awaits me.

I guess I wish myself luck for that too ;).
