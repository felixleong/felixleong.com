{% mark post -%}Originally posted as my reply to a post, but I would love to share this with everybody:

<b>[:: quote from a friend ::]</b>
今天我可能错过了一生中一次重要的机会。
回头想想，我曾经错过很多次机会，并不是我不在意，而是没有把握好，没有珍惜，或者说是没有来得及把握，它已经从身边悄悄溜

这令我又想起了那句经典的台词：
曾经有一次重要的机会放在我的面前，我没有珍惜，等我失去的时候我才后悔莫及，人世间最痛苦的事莫过于此。如果上天能够给我一个再来一次的机会，我会对那次机会说：我要。如果非要在这次机会上加上一个期限，我希望是…再多一天！

同样的机会不会出现第二次，我应该怎样才能把握好下一次，才不会让它在身边悄悄走过呢

Today I might have missed one of the most important chance in life.
Looking back, I had missed a lot of chances in the past, but it&apos;s not that I didn&apos;t mind at all, but it&apos;s that I never grasp these chances well, never treasured them; or should I say that by the time I wanted to grab it, the chance has already slipped away.

This reminds me of these classic words again:
There was a time that an important chance is being placed in front of me, I never treasure it, until the time when I missed it I started to regret about it, that&apos;s the greatest pain in life. If God were to give me another chance, I&apos;ll tell that chance: I want it/you. If this chance has to have an extention of expiration, my wish is… Just one more day.

The same chance will not appear twice, what should I do so that I can grab it well the next, so that it doesn&apos;t slip from me again?

机会…何谓机会？机会乃是人的希望而生，也由绝望而存。若是把一个未来的可能性看成是一个真实，它是机会；同样当我们把一个过去的选择看成是一个真实的可能性，它也是叫做机会。

它们的不同点在哪里呢？或许最明显的答案是就是一个还可能会发生，一个是不可能会发生。但是，他们独特的地方…不是一个不同点，而是一个共同点：它们…只是一个幻像。他们虽有它的真实性，但是，他们现在都不是事实：一个已经发生了，一个还没到来。

唯一的真实：就是现在，唯一的机会：就是把握现在。这就是“活在当下”的精髓：一个没有机会存在，但是充满了活跃的可能性的人生！

你…有没有把握着现在呢…？

Chance… what is chance? A chance is born from our own hopes, and it&apos;s also survived with our regrets as well. When we see a future possibility as a possible reality: then it&apos;s a chance; Same goes to the fact that when we see a past decision as a possible, present reality: that is also called a chance.

What&apos;s the difference between them? Maybe the most obvious answer is that this chance can be either a possibility, and another is an impossibility. But what makes them special… is not their differences, but their similarities: They… are only a maya. They do have their points of being real, but they aren&apos;t real now: One has been passed, the other haven&apos;t arrived.

The only reality is now, the only chance is to grasp what you have today. This is the essense of "Living today to the fullest": There&apos;s no chances exists, but a life is full of lively possibilities!

Have you… grasp what you have today…?{%- endmark %}
