{% mark post -%}Yesterday wasn&apos;t really a good day for me as I found myself having a heavy heart for no apparent reason (wellâ€¦ there might be a reason, but it&apos;s really something that I can&apos;t really comprehend well, in a sense) Sometimes I do wonder whether people can influence each other feelings, even just by being close to them. But probably there&apos;s just too much not-so-happy incidents happening to my friends that I&apos;m really concern about them.

Anyway, Theen Gee, who has been my roommate for 2 months, will be moving as his industrial training is over (and his semester is going to start on next month). There&apos;ll be a farewell dinner for him tonight.That pretty much means that I&apos;ll having the room for myself, which I really have some mixed feelings for it, bt I&apos;ll be OK :). Probably I would miss sharing my drifting thoughts with him (that&apos;s the reason if you did notice that I didn&apos;t post much over here in LJ).

Anyway, it&apos;s a fresh day today :). Better get myself back into position.{%- endmark %}
