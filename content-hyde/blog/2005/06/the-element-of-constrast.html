{% mark post -%}Just came back from watching Mr and Mrs Smith with Jacob. :) They movie is a good watch, honestly I was expecting more action than comedy but it turns out to be a comedy with some action elements in it. The great thing I really liked about the movie is that it uses a lot of elements of contrast in the whole movie: everything including the visuals, character development, plot, the pacing of the movie… the most interesting part is how they twist the man/woman stereotype in certain aspects that make Pitt and Jolie interesting to watch :) (probably I would say that they are dysfunctional from my own point of view :p).

However, as said, it&apos;s only a good comedy, not a great one. The jokes are more like "OMG! Did she/he do that?" kind of jokes and not the kind that would really crack me up like mad. But I would say the jokes are pretty good (instead of being mediocre or lame) is that they reflects on marriages in the modern society. Another rant I would say that sometimes the pacing does seem a tad too slow, probably because the fast-paced action sequences are highly intense. I almost got the slight snoozes at some point of the movie. As much as I appreciated the fact that the fast-slow movie pacing contrast does spice up some of the humour, but I believe the director can further refine it to make it less tiring at some point.

Anyway~~~ the action sequence is a definite watch! :D And I&apos;m still wondering why the censors give it a 18-PG (violence and horror) instead of the 18-PL (combination of elements not suitable for minors) seeing that there&apos;s a lot of "implied" sex scenes throughout the whole movie (with I suspect that the censors have put their scissors on the film… but then again, they are pretty lenient this time round).

I think I have to go to sleep now as I need more rest after my blood donation. Does seems that I really need more rest and energy to recover from it :). Ja&apos;ne!{%- endmark %}
