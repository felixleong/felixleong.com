It's the fourth day of Chinese New Year: while the working classes are reporting back into their offices and started work, I'm still back with my parents. My laptop flipped open with the backlit display shining at me, my stationeries and notebook spread across the dining table among the containers of Chinese New Year snacks. I've made the dining table back home my remote office.

After a series of hackathons, I'm starting to experiment with how to work in remote locations -- outside the comforts of office cubicles where everything is within reach and I never need to worry out running out of office supplies. It's always about learning to deal with small desk spaces, less than optimal furniture in terms of ergonomics and tuning out ambient noises and distractions from my surroundings. That as well as figuring out the minimal gear required and how to psyche myself into high productivity mode despite all odds.

Working from my parents' place is one interesting experience: while having all the creature comforts you'd expect from a home, I'm kind of obliged to interact with my parents and help out when needed. Am glad that I brought my headphones with me to drown out the roaring vacuum cleaner and television. Greatest distraction? Fluffy beds and comfy sofas, I guess :).

So far I'm able to iron out bugs from my website and I'm currently wrapping up a freelance project that I've been working for months -- something that I'm really looking forward to completing as I'd be able to take on other projects in the pipeline.

So far so good. Now I just need to figure out a sure-fire way to get myself in the high-productivity zone as soon as possible.
