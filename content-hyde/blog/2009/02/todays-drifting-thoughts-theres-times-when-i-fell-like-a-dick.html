Recently been reading, listening and watching stuff from successful people via blogs, articles, books, podcasts and webcasts. So much in fact that I felt quite overwhelmed, in a way.</p><p>It quite funny in the sense that when your eyes are much more open once you listen to the more enlighten spots that people had reached, it's hard not to feel a bitâ€¦ ummm, small? ^-^|| Like, at some point the feeling of being inferior sort of kicks in and makes me anxious and impatient to get into the spot of "being successful", even though I'd admit now that the definition of "success" is more like "whatever they had achieved". For one thing there's nothing wrong about wanting what people have had right now, just that it'd be counter productive if the bar of my expectations was set perceptually too high that dampens my spirit to achieve them.</p><p>For now, I'm still sorting out my dreams and goals and compartmentalize them in some way. I think it'd be better that way rather than facing a unconquerable mountain of messy dreams. Then it's the perfect time to do some soul searching as well as doing small acts towards achieving them.</p>{%- endmark %}
