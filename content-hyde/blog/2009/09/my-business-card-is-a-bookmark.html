Having the reading habit, a bookmark is the indispensable must-have. And recently I find that my business card make good bookmarks.

It used to be whatever scrap paper that I conveniently picked up whenever I started the book and it'd typically be receipts of whichever restaurant that I happen to be at that time. But honestly speaking, receipts were never attractive in the first place, other than the fact that the strip of paper have lots of note taking space that up until now I'd never bothered to use.

It started off as a habit of convenience as I picked up my business card and slip in between the pages. And it later dawn on me that it is just perfect for that purpose. Business cards are stiff enough that it's quite easy to locate it even when it's buried within the book and they has an extra functionality to be used as a reading guide, acting as a beginner's guide to speed reading by sliding it down through the pages.

And what makes perfect business sense is that upon meeting someone interesting during my commute, I don't need to fumble through my pockets to find my business card: I just pass them my bookmark. And it's pretty convenient for me replace it with a new one. (though, with honest disclosure, I haven't get the chance to do soâ€¦ yet)

This is one of the art that I have drawn the back of my business card. Probably it'd make sense to duplicate the art to my current business card stock? Well, that'd probably make a lot of sense.{%- endmark %}
