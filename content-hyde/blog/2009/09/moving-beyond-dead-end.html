<p style="text-align: left;">Being human, we are bound to feel disappointed sometimes. Some that we could sleep over it, and some so devastating that it's hard not to feel completely torn. And to some (myself included), we just couldn't help but being swamped by such desperation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facing such an obstacle in front of us, it may be easy to feel despair and helpless. That's just how we were wired, I guess – sometimes when we have our eyes so set on what we wanted, our focus became so narrow that we couldn't see the surroundings and realities that was slightly beyond the narrow perimeter of our sights.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Probably that's how life give us reminders – once faced with a dead-end, it forces us to set our sights on the present reality, take a few steps back and survey our options. That's exactly the kind of mindset that creativity requires: without space to breathe, our creative potential is practically stunted.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Once we got over that feeling, just dust ourselves with the assurance that we had learned our lessons and determined to do what we had decided after a reassessment of our situation. After all, if the final goal is greatly important and worth pursuing, perseverance is just a quality that comes naturally.</p>{%- endmark %}
