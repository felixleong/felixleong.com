{% mark post -%}Wee… Three entries in one day! XD That&apos;s getting rare lately :p.

Anyway, as much as I was hoping that it&apos;s not going to rain… it does, in a REALLY big way. If you need something to relate to, imagine a nasty storm which would have let you feel like you are in the set in The Day After Tomorrow, minus the large hails, tsunami etc. It&apos;s that bad.

And worse, I HATE ACID RAIN! And I would never see a BBQ curry taste junk food the same way again, judging that the rain smell like it. And it&apos;s a big ouch when you have one of those slight burning feeling while being hit by one of those innocent-looking raindrops.

So now I&apos;m stuck in Starbucks in hope that it&apos;ll stop soon. Have their coffee of the day today (Today&apos;s Verona), and I&apos;m sipping it from the cup while looking at the nasty storm outdoors… Which is… really a stark contrast with the comfy setting in Starbucks.

Anyway, Allen sent me this song… and it&apos;s really relaxing, for one thing ^^.{%- endmark %}
