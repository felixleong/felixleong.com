{% mark post -%}Um… really… Am I?

Anyway, it always seemed that I worry to much on a lot of things. Well… especially when I&apos;m dealing with things which is beyond my control. This morning I woke up worrying about my parcels, especially the new batch of books being addressed to my aunt&apos;s house. Next was a parcel of CDs which I don&apos;t even know whether it got sent yet (as much as I trusted that it will be)…. and lastly a few letters which I&apos;m expecting to receive sometime later. I don&apos;t know… In the age that everything has to be really fast, good old snail mail is still slow… well, it&apos;s fast enough though. I wonder how was it like during the old days, where postal service is the best that you can get.

Then next up is when I&apos;m renewing my identity card, I&apos;m getting a little bit nervous about it, feeling that I might have forget a document or two. But everything seems to be fine and swift though. Just one form, a picture taken and digital thumb prints. I didn&apos;t get to chance to see how did I look in the picture, but peeping on the screen, it looked pretty good though :p.

Then at night, I went to the supermarket where my best friend, Kang Jun, is working and I get to chat with him. Business was pretty slow there when I met up with him, so that gives us a lot of time to chat like nobody&apos;s business. I get to know a lot of news updates about my old friends whom are not around, and the most saddening news that I heard was one of my friends&apos; brother got killed in a car crash a month ago. My sympathies for him. Other than that, a few of my friends gets into a relationship, that&apos;s a good thing.

I was thinking of breaking out my news with Allen though… but then I held back, and the only thing that we chatted about in the relationship department is my ex-crush and nothing else. Walking home, I didn&apos;t felt too well emotionally though: no, it&apos;s nothing major, but it did kept me pondering a lot about me holding back the news. As much as that he was my best friend, I still can&apos;t find courage to tell him about it.

Is it that I&apos;m avoiding the pain? (referring to the previous incident that I feel that a door being slammed on my face when I broke the news to another good friend of mine… well, I know Kang Jun is open to it, but yet…) Or is it that there&apos;s things that I don&apos;t really trust… whatever that is? Is it my initial doubts? Or is it the trust that I had for my friends and family? …Or is it that I doubt myself? I wished I knew though. Umm… Actually there&apos;s something that happened to my sweetie that I should feel at least unhappy, or at least jealous, but I didn&apos;t feel anything… Until now.

… I think I&apos;m becoming a worry wart or something. Any sort of reassurance that I can get, anyone? Umm… anyone?

Well… I have been using my family phone line, which is pretty much being extremely close to my family computer. So I won&apos;t be online much lately except for posting daily journal updates.{%- endmark %}
