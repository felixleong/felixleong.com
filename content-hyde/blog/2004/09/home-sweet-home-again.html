{% mark post -%}I&apos;m safe at home right now :).

Anyway, just a run down:
- I only noticed that my cam is stolen! Grr for evil people, but that serves me a good lesson that I shouldn&apos;t be careless and I should have keep an eye on my bag while I left it outside the lab (stupid lab usage rules >.<").

Anyway, still thinking whether I should use my loan money to buy a new camera (I was eyeing on a Canon Powershot) ;___;.

- Aunt Maggie just moved in her new house, nothing to shout about though.

- Gotta love my parents and my sister back home <3, they always made my stay back home very relaxing :)

I think that&apos;s it. :) I&apos;ll try to get photos of my aunt&apos;s wedding… by using her digital camera XD.

And thank god I passed my Entrepreneurial Skills exams… so that&apos;s a C at my part.{%- endmark %}
