{% mark post -%}Yay for Coach Vee in sending this <3. Now I really think of venturing into older Eurobeat someday :).

Today&apos;s pretty much a slow day… I woke up *very* late today, 1:30 in the afternoon, to be exact. @_@ The printer service staff wasn&apos;t here today, which does somewhat make me quite furious >.<". Think I might give them another call tomorrow.

So as expected, my mood isn&apos;t getting anywhere from cheery lately… you know, with all those spoilt hardware lying around and extremely annoying warranty claims to make. OK, maybe I shouldn&apos;t be that bothered, but then again that thought isn&apos;t getting anywhere from lifting my moods up. :(

Anyway, just now I just came back from my aunt&apos;s wedding dinner (2nd round :) ). The food is great :), but now I&apos;m not feeling that well for some reasons… maybe I just had too much meat, considering that I&apos;m a partial vegetarian now.

Anyway, gotta sleep early today because tomorrow&apos;s my appointment with our project supervisor… and to be honest I feel a bit bad because it seems that I didn&apos;t do anything yet :(. But looking at the bright side of things Choon Hui will be there tomorrow, so yeah :).

Till then… anyone knows how to cure a down-ish mood now? (otherwise a hug would do){%- endmark %}
