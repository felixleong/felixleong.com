{% mark post -%}Yay! I&apos;m off to Penang tomorrow :). So I won&apos;t be updating much on my LJ during my trip there, but rest assured that I keep you guys updated once I had the chance ;).

Anyway, I sent my webcam to the shop and it was found to be faulty. So I got a new webcam that works ^^. So, to translate it, that means more para videos soon :). In other news, my laser printer is fixed as well, and most probably I would get it on Monday.

Today I only notice that I can be quite insecure at times, especially in times when I feel a bit overwhelmed by misfortunes, some good nudging from Steven does helps me to notice that I can do much more despite of my own doubts. Well… at least that&apos;s how I looked at it :).

Anyway, I gotta pack now :).

[p/s: For the MindMap thingy, I believe I figured it out some part of it, it&apos;s basically organized based on the LJ friends list, since I did notice that my RPGamer friends and my ParaparaStage friends are somewhat gathered quite close together with each other.

As for the closeness factor, I&apos;m still figuring that out. But I suppose it shows the person with the most similar contacts and stuff. I wonder…]{%- endmark %}
