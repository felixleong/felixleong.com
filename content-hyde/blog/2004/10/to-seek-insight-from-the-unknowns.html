{% mark post -%}For a bad start, I wasn&apos;t feeling that well emotionally today: It&apos;s like suddenly I have been experiencing a feeling which is indescribable. A feeling that one is not feeling good, yet it&apos;s not totally negative either. A feeling which seems like emptiness, and yet you can still feel something in existence. A feeling so light and of less importance, yet it&apos;s so heavy that you can feel its burden. I has not been the first time I have this kind of feeling, yet I&apos;m still (and currently still) unable to comprehend this simple yet complex feeling.

The feeling is so hard to bear… that I just have to go out for a fresh breath of air. And as usual with my outdoor strolls, I usually have my brain triggered by asking a lot of questions: mostly to reflect upon situations and myself. Just a lot of questions awaits to be answered… about my own feelings, the situations that I&apos;m in, the observations that I had… Guess I&apos;m just introspective :p.

But that does help a lot, I manage to answer some of my own questions and doubts, and to be able to analyse and piecing together part of my puzzle of thoughts. Went to the bookstore and read more books later, one book which really interest me for the time being is <i>Tarot in the spirit of Zen: The Game of Life</i> by Osho. The book really clicked with me since it has a unique interpretation of the cards, which focuses on the virtues of Zen and Buddhism. As much as its title states that it&apos;s a book about tarot, but it can be read as a book on self-exploration and personal transformation. A really interesting read indeed :). (and I got a copy for myself)

Anyway, currently I&apos;m way behind schedule in some work. Guess who really needs discipline classes now?{%- endmark %}
