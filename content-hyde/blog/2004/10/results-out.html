---
GPA (based on my calculation, if I&apos;m not mistaken with the grade stuff): 3.5
[:: Edit: Just recalculated with some corrections made ^^" ::]

Interpersonal Communication: I didn&apos;t really expect an A for this since I can&apos;t finish one of the questions. But as it turns out, I&apos;m so glad with this ^^. Thanks Ms Nicole for her great and inspiring class!

Entrepreneurial Skills and Business Ethics: I&apos;m just glad that I didn&apos;t get any worse than this. Period ^^"

Software Engineering Practice: I was quite worried when I didn&apos;t fared well in my mid-term exams, but good thing that I prepared early. It&apos;s a A-, but it&apos;s still great BTW :).

Object-Oriented Programming Techniques: I didn&apos;t put high hopes on this one every since I screwed my coursework marks, not to mention that it takes up 35% of the grades. But as it turns out, grades can be saved with more effort ^^.

Advanced Artificial Intelligence: I said to myself that I&apos;d be REALLY sorry to Dr Tay if I didn&apos;t get an A for his subject. And so I did. This A is dedicated to you, for being such a kind, understanding and great professor, Dr Tay ^^.

Cryptography: I didn&apos;t did well in this subject, but thank god that proves that I did most part of it right ^^.

OMG… OMG… OMG!!!! I can&apos;t believe it! This is the best results I ever get ever since I get into this university! :D

I&apos;m SOOOO excited right now~ Bwee~~~~ :D

Thanks everybody for wishing me luck yesterday! All the love goes to you guys there ^^. *glomps everyone* <333{%- endmark %}
