{% mark post -%}Hmm… just the typical rainy day. Nothing much happened honestly except my sluggishness.

Been reading a bit of Tarot in the Spirit of Zen, it&apos;s been quite a while since I last read any self-help books (like… months ago?). And thus far it&apos;s really interesting, as well as giving some time for my brain cells to jog a bit, to reflect on my own past, present and state of mind. Somewhat it&apos;s a really wonderful experience when you just notice how much clearer you can think when you start to let go of your ego.

There&apos;s some things in the book which seems a bit radical for me, but just to pull a quote from the book itself <i>"Keep what I am saying to you. Make a jeweled box for it. <b>Don&apos;t take it as wisdom but only as information</b>. Consciously make a box for it. Then gradually you will find, as experience begin happening, that my words arise from your unconscious, and make clear and comprehensible the experience that happen."</i> (extracted from pg. 39, from the chapter XVI. Thunderbold (The Tower in your typical Rider-Waite deck))

Okay… but that highlighted sentence seems to strike me somehow, for some unknown reasons.

Guess that&apos;s pretty much for today :).{%- endmark %}
