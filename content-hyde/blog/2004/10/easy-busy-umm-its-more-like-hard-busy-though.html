{% mark post -%}After a few days of deep posts, guess it&apos;s time to revert back to its normal stuff that you&apos;ll see on my LJ :).

Anyway… Things are getting EXTREMELY busy lately, considering that I&apos;ll be having my Numerical Analysis and Mathematics for Computer Graphics class (for those who remembered, yup, I&apos;m retaking the <i>only</i> subject with a D attached to it), Japanese class, final year project and… a job! And not to mention that the job starts tomorrow and I have to work from 9-6 for three days weekly. So that also means that less time for me to fool around. And that also means that my online presence would be even thinner (Sorry Ahmed ;_;).

I&apos;ll still be in contact with you guys, through the old-fashioned way: e-mail! ^^ For those who would like to have a short chatter with me, feel free to drop me an email or two, that would really be a good way to relieve stress during working hours ^^.

As for what had happened today, I went with Yong Ling to survery around my workplace and its surroundings. Got to meet Albert (the boss) and talked a lot about the job and technology stuff. And lucky thing is that he provides free accomodation, that means that I don&apos;t have to travel a lot in order to work on the job. Currently I&apos;ll be under the same roof with another employee, Srida. He&apos;s one programmer from India (if I&apos;m not mistaken), and hopefully that things will go well.

What else… yeah, for some reasons, it just seems that I get to meet a lot of my great friends today, as much as I don&apos;t know whether that was by sheer chance or something. But it&apos;s glad to see them around. ^^

Yeah, I&apos;m still a bit nervous about everything, on how to handle the things around me. Just wish me luck! ^^
