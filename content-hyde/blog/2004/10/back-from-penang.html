{% mark post -%}Just came back from Penang safely :).

Anyway, nothing beats plain old fun with friends, Erika, Rachael, Soo Hoo, Jeeva and Stanley has been extremely fun to be with :). So we have been going to places like Penang Hill and Kek Lok Si (literally translated from Chinese as The Temple of Eternal Happiness). There is only a few tourist attractions that we went, since it kept on raining during our trip. But then again, I have visited these places already, just that Rachael haven&apos;t been there, so it&apos;s kinda fun taking Rachael to tour around the place. Of course we did take a lot of pictures there :), with me being kinda evil by taking tons of candid shots of the girls XD. I&apos;m SOOO~ evil :p. (I think I&apos;ll post some pictures once I got them from Rachael)

Of course, when Penang is mentioned, definitely there&apos;s food <333! Gotta love the food there, not to mention Erika&apos;s mother cooking <333 (as much as the curry is ULTRA hot XD). Too bad we didn&apos;t get to taste her mother&apos;s food because we had too much food before we reached home :(. Other than that, it&apos;s pretty much shopping mall strolling and some Parapara machine goodness :p. Luckily I do meet with Stanley that time, otherwise I have to play alone even there&apos;s a linked machine there :).

Wellâ€¦ now I&apos;m at home, just typing away on my keyboard :). Yay for SEB120 reaching on my doorstep <3. Listening it another time, it sounded so cool now :)! (Months ago I said that it was not too impressive, I&apos;m taking that back now :), since I started to learn how to enjoy newer Eurobeat tracks now) So, ja&apos;ne <3!{%- endmark %}
