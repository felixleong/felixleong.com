{% mark post -%}This is a good punishment for doing assignments the last minute (well… at least I can rearrange my room&apos;s furniture back):

<a href="http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/room/room1.jpg">My cluttered desk</a>
<a href="http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/room/room2.jpg">The small table next to me that forms the cubicle (Yum! Cheez-It!)</a>
<a href="http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/room/room3.jpg">Books that I wanted to read… but I had no time ;__;</a>

No sleep yesterday… kinda… dizzy…{%- endmark %}
