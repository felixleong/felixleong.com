{% mark post -%}Apparently today&apos;s headache isn&apos;t just a normal headache: it&apos;s the cluster headache curse. Augh! That wasn&apos;t fun, sometimes the headache get so intense that I&apos;m sweating profusely and feeling like throwing up. So the journey home on the bus wasn&apos;t totally pleasant and I just have to close my eyes and keep on rubbing on my temples just to ease the pain.

After that, I just have to go to the supermarket and get some aspirins and restock some other titbits and late night snacks (cookies! ^_^). Then I just happen to pass by the soup section where you can see rows of tins with red-and-white stripes (no prizes on guessing what brand was that), then kind words from maryadavies and drifting_floe came to mind and the word "chicken soup" just happen to cross over. So I just plunk in one can of chicken and mushroom soup into my basket.

Then just after I had dinner outside, I took one aspirin on the spot and walked home. And in no time, I feel all dizzy and sleepy. I never knew that aspirins had side-effects! Perhaps I didn&apos;t believe in medicine all along and that just slip out of my mind :p (Guess I have to study a bit now). Luckily I reach home safely and soon enough, and got some rest.

Hours later, feeling better, I remember the tin of soup that I had just bought. Kinds of remind me that how I liked Western-styled soup and I don&apos;t really have the chance to enjoy it because the only place that I can afford to enjoy it is at Pizza Hut. Chinese-styled soup that my mom used to prepare slightly differs in the sense that it&apos;s much more watery (it&apos;s like drinking water sometimes) and really good soup have tons of ingredients and herbs inside it. The taste and texture of Chinese-styled soup is rich in a different way compared to Western-styled ones. Both of them have their own unique properties and I liked them both. (although I do slightly prefer Western in terms of its simplicity and texture)

Back onto the topic, there I go to the kitchen and fumbling in the drawers to find a can-opener. I didn&apos;t really get to know my aunt&apos;s kitchen well since the only thing that I cook is instant noodles, but today does mark a good change. Then after spending quite some time fidgeting the can-opener (I can&apos;t remember the last time I *actually* use one of those utensils), and I just follow the instructions on the can. I can&apos;t seem to find a egg-beater anywhere so I use a pair of wooden chopsticks to mix the condense soup well with water. Then I put it on top of the stove and hope that I got everything right.

And now, I got a good bowl of soup just next to me. And boy, I do enjoy it with a small sense of achievement ^_^v. That does slightly ignite my interest in cooking. Hmm… maybe I might ask my father for some tips soon… and no prizes of guessing what will be the first thing that I&apos;ll learn first!{%- endmark %}
