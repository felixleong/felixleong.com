{% mark post -%}Well… I would say that today has marked some changes within myself, not really a new beginning, but I think it&apos;s major enough to consider it as a change.

If you had followed my previous entries, today&apos;s is my previous crush&apos;s birthday (Happy birthday! Bean! :D)… which also marks 1.5 year anniversary that I had constantly feeling hurt deep down. Well… it&apos;s not that my hurts are caused by him, but it&apos;s pretty much the contrary: I&apos;m the one hurting myself because I kept on clinging on with a love which is impossible to preach. He didn&apos;t do anything to hurt me (well… perhaps in a few occasions that I&apos;ve been "used"… not in sexual context, mind ya XD), but perhaps I&apos;m at wrong for invading his private space while he didn&apos;t gave me permission to.

I&apos;ve been struggling with myself: crying so many times that I had lost count, fantasizing him so much that I had become obsessive, feeling down so many times that I feel unloved… As much as I tell myself that I have to let it go, I didn&apos;t… I was living a dream… but I hate to admit it…

If you have been reading my previous poems (specifically Empty Bed, Music Box and Parallel Loners), I admit that my inspiration is based on that imaginary relationship that will not happen. Bean, if you are reading this (which I really doubt that you do, since I never give out the address except in the forums that I participated), these are dedicated to you… and I wish to tell you that I love you so much. But I have to put a stop now…

Now, my hurts are already healed (I don&apos;t really know, but I feeling of being hurt is gone now), and I decided to lock this feeling a beautiful place deep down in my heart… and pass the key… to you, Bean. I&apos;ll always appreciate you as a friend, and I&apos;ll always do until my life ended, and I&apos;ll always be proud with you. You taught me what is love, and how to love someone unconditionally. I learned how to appreciate life as it is and to be proud of who I am. Sometimes, I just have to let something dear go, and I think I&apos;m able to do it now… I can&apos;t put all my energy towards something impossible, since I now understand that there more friends who requires my undivided attention, there&apos;s more things in life that I have to enjoy without you, and I can&apos;t force upon you to love me.

But… if in any hope… that you&apos;ll love and appreciate me… rest assured that you&apos;ve the key to rekindle the same passion I had for you in the past. But for now, you&apos;re still my special friend. *gulps down a few tears*

As for now, I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;m ready for another relationship… to share the up and downs with me. As much as I know there&apos;s an empty space to be filled… I really don&apos;t want to force myself to love just for the sake of loving. Till the time comes, I&apos;ll know… and I&apos;m sure (or at least I&apos;m praying) that I&apos;m able to find someone.

May all of you, loved or unloved, be blessed…{%- endmark %}
