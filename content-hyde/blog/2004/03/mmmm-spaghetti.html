{% mark post -%}One good reasons on staying with your aunt than your coursemates: You don&apos;t even need to learn how to cook :p. Well maybe I just said so because I just had home made spaghetti just now. Tasty!

In other news, I just finished Eurobeat part for my Flash assignment. Oh boy! I&apos;m going to finish this assignment! And… *stares at my in-tray* God… school sucks. :p Hope I&apos;ll survive.{%- endmark %}
