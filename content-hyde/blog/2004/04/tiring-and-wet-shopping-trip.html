{% mark post -%}Remember the fuss I made yesterday about buying cosmetics? Well, today I just give it another go, this time at KLCC, one of the most high-class shopping complex you can get in the capital of Malaysia. Just that this time I&apos;m absolutely sure that Red Earth has a kiosk there, so there, save me the trouble in finding it. Just when I was boarding a LRT (light rail transit) over there, my mom called me to ask me to get a printer. OK, no big deal, I thought.

So just as soon as I got off the train, I go straight to the kiosk before I started to make a fuss out of it. And just as I thought it&apos;s going to be expensive, no… to my surprise, it isn&apos;t. Well… one tray of newest eye shadow for about RM30 (less than US$10). But when I started to approach the girl who is on duty… I started to get a bit nervous. But luckily I didn&apos;t stammer though (I have that tendency when I&apos;m nervous), then she just smiled, direct me to where the samples are placed. And oh wow! I never knew that the ACID 5 series contains eye shadows, lip gloss, and lifting mist which comes in five different colours (or perhaps flavours, since their names are something like lemon, peppermint, lemon, grapefruit and tea… can&apos;t remember the last one though XD). Then I just politely told the salesgirl that I need to ask my friend and I&apos;ll be back later. And so I did: I send a message to Katsuya and went off to Kinokuniya for some books.

After a while, he replied me that he only wanted the lavender lifting mist and I go back down to the kiosk and get it. Somewhat when she sees me, I saw her face brighten up all of a sudden. After I got the requested bottle of lifting mist and paid her, she just passed me the plastic bag with the broadest and perhaps loveliest smile I have ever seen. Hmm… I wonder whether it&apos;s because she disclosed the sale so easily (I didn&apos;t do any sort of bargaining and asking a hell of questions), or is it that seeing there&apos;s hope of asking boyfriends to buy cosmetics XD. Well… I guess it only part of the excellent service package.

Just as soon as I was thinking of getting out, it rained heavily. Darn! As much as I had brought my umbrella, it&apos;s only managed to keeping my upper body dry while the rain either splashed or trickled down to my jeans and my shoes! And having wet shoes and jeans is no fun, when I walk it&apos;s feels like water is squeaking inside. Not to mention that when it does dry, the bacteria in the shoes is enough to give a nasty itch! Augh!

Then I went to Tower Records in KL Plaza, found the PPP2 soundtrack CD and I bought that for Hang, when I passed the CD to him, I saw a bright sparkle in his eyes. Hmm… Getting rare CD is always a surprise :p. Then I *finally* went to the computer shop and trying to hunt down a cheap printer. After quite some time, I got the cheapest Epson printer and a cooling pad for my notebook (hope that does help to cure that nasty overheating problem).

Obviously, the torture didn&apos;t end there: getting back to the nearest LRT station requires me to walk for about 20 minutes… with an extra 5~10kg burden. And it&apos;s drizzling out there. So that make it tougher by having to carrying the printer and holding the umbrella at the same time. And believe me, the printer only feels light for the first 5 minutes of the journey. XD

Anyway, now I&apos;m at home… feeling tired all over again, at the same time having a fan blowing at my shoes, hoping that they&apos;ll dry by tomorrow (or else I would have to go through that wet shoes hell all over again). And now I&apos;m starting to pack my stuff for the Penang trip.Hope I&apos;ll have a good time there (and YAY! I finally got to try a PPP linked machine and have fun with my favourite PPP 1st Mix Plus! ^^). I&apos;ll try to get some pictures when I got there ;).

Ja &apos;ne!

[:: Random Thoughts ::]
- Rewinding back, my morning wasn&apos;t too good… I have been missing my ex-crush. As much as I have said I have to lock that away, there&apos;s always a string left in my heart… tugging every now and then. Yeah, I still love him no matter what happens, but I don&apos;t really like to open the box full of memories, the more I opened it, the harder it gets to close it… I think I got this from the movie, Peter Pan.
- I hate having self doubts, it always holds me back in doing anything… I think I&apos;ll leave that as my thought of the day later.{%- endmark %}
