{% mark post -%}My other aunt drop by today to give me a package from my parents. And I&apos;m pretty much notified by my mom beforehand, so this is pretty much expected. And… well… Got a few bottles of health supplements (Gosh my mom is believer in health supplements, she&apos;s not overzealous about them but I&apos;m pretty much the forgetful kid who always miss his tablet taking routines), which includes a bottle of garlic pearls, sustained release Vitamin C, chewable Colostrum, Spirulina and natural biotics. So now she&apos;s stressing me to make sure that I take three of them (Colostrum, Spirulina and natural biotics) on top with my daily regime of multivitamins. Oh great… *make mental notes in mind*

Together with those health supplements is a package sent to me by an online bookstore (I used my hometown&apos;s address a while back), inside it is a cool package notifying I have automatically upgraded to privilege member status and I have personal customer support line. Hmm :). And that&apos;s not all, I got a RM20 voucher and cool name card holder with it. Well… I can&apos;t find any use of the name card holder, but the metallic silver with indigo highlights are really cool. Guess I don&apos;t need to get one when I started to work. The voucher has been expired though (since it is sent to my home last month), but I don&apos;t really think that I want to buy RM200 worth of books just to use the voucher anyway. :p

But just for the kick of it, I browse around the online bookstore and add a few more books into my wishlist (which includes a self-help book on Japanese and desktop publishing). As much as my course didn&apos;t study desktop publishing (heck! I&apos;m not studying a design course in the first place!), I just got the interest of designing layout for publishing material as a hobby lately. So I guess I might get them soon… as much as the loan I recently get is tempting me really hard to get the stuff that I drooled for a long time. Gosh, I have put myself into unnecessary dilemma again. Maybe I should consider investing some amount of money after I had paid my school fees for next semester. *Makes another mental note*

Somewhat I feel that I can certainly learn a lot from Dom, hearing that she&apos;d put up some ebay auctions during her Japan trip (Wow! I certainly never thought of THAT!). What a business woman she is! I really admire her for that ^-^, yet I just sitting in front of my exam materials and a radiation source doing pretty much nothing.

Anyway, better don&apos;t think to much for the time being and focus on my readings… as much I was distracted on thinking suitable money making ideas. Gosh I think I&apos;m daydreaming again. :p{%- endmark %}
