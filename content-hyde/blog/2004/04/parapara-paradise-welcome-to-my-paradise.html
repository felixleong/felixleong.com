{% mark post -%}Hmm… actually this should two entries instead of one, but since I didn&apos;t get online to get the older one posted, I guess I just combine them into one. Here goes nothing~

<b>Around 2 am:</b>
Oooh ooh ooh~ just got my performance mix mixed by Michael (dJeu)! :D I&apos;m really excited when it gets patched through into my system, not everything goes well though… while he&apos;s halfway in sending it through, I just finished updating my firewall software… and accidentally said Yes when it ask whether I wanted to restart my computer. Noooo~! Then when I want to log back into MSN Messenger*, Microsoft seems to pick a right timing to put up a new version of MSN, halting me from getting into MSN <b>unless</b> I get the update. Augh! >_<

Luckily Michael is kind enough to upload it up over a webspace so that I can snag it off from there, thanks a million, Michael! *^0^*

I&apos;m really glad to say that the mix is great, as much as Michael did mentioned that he&apos;s not too satisfied the fact that "Palapala Paladise, Welcome to my paladise" (Engrish XD) has somewhat been overused. Hmmm… I dunno, I kinda like it being repeated over several parts of the song, making it sound like a recurring theme (hey! It&apos;s about Parapara all right! *^^*).

Dance wise… Hmm… I don&apos;t know, maybe it&apos;s my drying creative juices, I just find most transition parts can go really nicely with stand still poses, but really, doing that during every single transition will make it VEEEEERY dull. But anyway, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll working on that since my exams are much more pressing, besides, I got a week to practice before I go to Penang. I don&apos;t know, maybe I&apos;ll get it filmed once I got the choreograph done.

Anyway, in other news:
- My game music MIDI collection is going to hit the 3600 mark. And almost all of them are only MIDIs for the RPGs that I had played before. I wonder what happens when I started to collect MIDIs for newer FFs (FF9 and above). Heh…
- Allen in not feeling well physically (gastric) and perhaps emotionally… makes me reallly worried about him. Really hoped that he gets better soon <=(.
- Having two math subjects is really evil. Guess I have to do some exercise right now.
- Tomorrow&apos;s going to be the coolest Parapara gathering where we&apos;ll be gathering outside the arcades! Wee… Can&apos;t wait!

[:: Notes ::]
* For those who didn&apos;t know, I&apos;m using Trillian as my main IM program. And apparently Trillian is still bad in file transfers… nothing gets through using Trill. And MSN is <b>THE</b> only independent IM that resides in my computer right now, which I only keep it for file transfers. >_>

<b>Now:</b>
Phew! Just came back from the gathering. Umm… no stage XD, since they have moved it elsewhere for some events downstairs, but we just sat in a corner in a mall, got our equipment (pretty much only an extension cord, a compact CD player, a set of cheap computer speakers and of course, Eurobeat CDs!) and just have fun on the corridor.

Yeah, it&apos;s pretty fun since it&apos;s the first time we bring Para out in public, and passer-bys often gave the "WTF?" kind of look XD. Anyway, have fun with a couple of songs (Heartbeat, and augh! I forgot the routine for Killing My Love). And the speakers are so loud that the hip-hop attire shop have to turn up their volume in attempt to drown our music… but failed XD. Yay to a pair of good speakers which only cost me RM25 (about US$8) XD. Somewhat doing it on the corridor instead of a proper stage made me feel like we&apos;re a bunch of bad kids loitering on the mall XD. (Maybe it&apos;s true? XD)

On my way back, I have a good conversation with some Mormon missionaries (hmm… *prods maryadavies*. Apparently there&apos;s a Latter Day Saints church near my aunt&apos;s place, and I have been bumping into a lot of missionaries during the past. It&apos;s quite fun talking to them though, although some of them did sound like religion salesperson (umm… no offence, guys, just have that kind of first impression on some). I haven&apos;t been to their church though, either my schedule is packed with my stuff, or it just me not really prepared to understand a belief deeply.

Hmmm… maybe I&apos;ll just drop by some day later. Anyway, gotta do some math exercise to warm myself up for the exams.{%- endmark %}
