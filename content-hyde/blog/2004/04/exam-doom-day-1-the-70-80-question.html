{% mark post -%}Augh! Didn&apos;t fare well for today&apos;s exams, I just do some calculations and estimate that I had lose enough marks to kiss an A goodbye. Gosh… I&apos;m really feeling like plunking my head on the keyboard. But I can&apos;t worry about that now, got six more subjects on the line… and I&apos;m not confident in every single one of them. Darn… lousiest semester. >_<" I suppose I had only myself to blame for my lack of preparation.

Anyway, to make things worse, my friend is going on the complain drive, it&apos;s starting to drive me up the roof. He had his point and most of them are pretty much valid, but really I don&apos;t feel like hearing a lot of them. It&apos;s just tiring. Anyway, I got two more days to do whatever I have to do, I guess I might show up tomorrow for the gathering some stress relief, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll stay there for long (unless I would like to risk my CGPA sliding down the drain.

And… um… I&apos;m just… tired… dead tired.

Which should be last if you had this statement: "The last entry is 70 followed by 80"??? I say 80, but there&apos;re people arguing for 70. What&apos;s your views on this?{%- endmark %}
