{% mark post -%}Originally this should be a drifting thought post, however all of a sudden while I&apos;m typing it through… the feelings seems to slip away from me. Maybe my own questions are answered? *Shrugs* I would never know…

[:: Retained Drifting Thoughts: Opening ::]
A constant sky blue thought has been in me… for the past few days… Clouds have been passing through this sky blue atmosphere in my heart, and curious I was to know what&apos;s behind them, I have been constantly looking at them with patience, looking through every single detail of the clouds while I&apos;m hoping that the sky will clear up.

And on the brief moment today that all of a sudden that… there&apos;s no more clouds, just a clear view of the sky blue of my own feelings… Somewhat it wasn&apos;t the way as I imagined it to be…

…

All I can say now is that… I&apos;m just grateful to be destined to meet two perfect people in the world, or at least the most perfect people in my own eyes.

Honestly up until now, I&apos;m still pretty confused myself… since I have been reading mixed signals: from myself and from others. Well… A firm decision has to be made (I think), and I believed that I really need the time to be single for now. There&apos;s just… a lot of… garbage accumulated in the past that I would want to take out. I really need the time to discover a lot of things myself: to sort out my own priorities, understand myself better… and to know what I really wanted in life.

For I know, dumping others with my own garbage will only bring more garbage in the end.

… For some reasons, I just laugh at the sentence above though. It just seems to me like irony for some reasons that I don&apos;t know. But… I guess the word love, in general terms, is just full of mysteries. And mysteries aren&apos;t supposed to be solved, for those which can be solved should be call uncharted territories to be discovered.

…

On a lighter note, I finally found a way to convert my protected WMAs into MP3s. It was tedious work, however at least I&apos;m able to load them into my iPod now :3. Oh joy! Somewhat it seems that I did lost some dimensions of the song during conversion, I wonder is it the fact that there&apos;re slight volume differences between the original WMA and the converted MP3 (with the MP3 having a slightly lower volume than the original). Hmmm…

And for some reasons… Nuage can&apos;t seem to get out from my head. ARRRGGHHH~~~!!! I can&apos;t believe that the song from a murderer* would sink in me!!!
[* For those who didn&apos;t really get the joke, Nuage "murdered" Karen&apos;s original <em>Nothing&apos;s Gonna Take My Love from You.</em>]

Well, there! :){%- endmark %}
