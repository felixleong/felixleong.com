{% mark post -%}Finally I got that stupid programming bug out. Phew… that&apos;s a really tough one to weed x_x".

Anyway… currently I&apos;m not feeling entirely well today, my head somewhat hurts a bit. A sign of minor illnesses, hoo hoo hoo… Guess that means that I need to keep tabs with my own well being.

More work awaits me to do… and honestly I feel overwhelmed x_x". Bleh… *doing it one at a time, tra la la~ :p*

Let me just do more artwork now.{%- endmark %}
