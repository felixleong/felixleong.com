{% mark post -%}Just something that I found funny just now, it&apos;s like… all of a sudden I kept on hearing buzzing noises somewhere, and later on the lights starts to flicker like mad… then all of a sudden the place got dark… everything went silent… After a while, the lights started to flicker again, with every single light flickering in dischord…seemingly to showing something sinister is coming…

… Then it gets dark again… no matter how hard I try to flick the switch… the switch only emits a buzzing sound… at the same time you can see there&apos;s flickering electric in it… scaring that something back is going to happen… I stayed back….

Everything is so spooky… I&apos;m starting to afraid… starting to afraid of the dark…

… Then… the lights are back on… and everything suddenly returns back to normal… In the sense of sudden peace and calmness… I seem to feel that I only feel more discomfort than relaxed…

Then… I start to switch my computer back again… And everything came back! The flickering lights, the buzzing noise…!!!

AHHHHHHH!!! MY COMPUTER IS POSSESSED BY AN EVIL SPIRIT!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH~~~!!!!!!

* something else happens… and it has to do with death… *

OK, seriously, after my close inspection, it&apos;s seems that my power cable is becoming faulty and it is starting to show signs that it&apos;s not safe to use already (I wouldn&apos;t want to cause a fire in the first place). And everything came back to normal when I replaced it with another power cable.

So there, that&apos;s my own horror story XDDD. (for those who want to experience that movie like effect, feel free to get that power cable from me, however, I have to disclaim the fact that I don&apos;t take any responsibilities if you computer get fried, your house caught on fire etc.){%- endmark %}
