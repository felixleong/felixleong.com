{% mark post -%}Originally posted in my university&apos;s forum, but the answers took me quite some time to craft, so I decided to post it here :):

This thread is started by my friend, Steven, BTW:
<b>当女人问你这三个问题时你会怎么回答</b>
1、你爱我什么？
2、在什么样情况下你就会不爱我？
3、假如我与别的男人发生了有性无爱的一夜情 你会怎么做？

<b>My Reply:</b>
哇！真的是很刁难人叻！

我的答案会是如此：

1. 我不能告诉你我爱你“什么”，因为三言两语是不能表达我爱你的一切。若是要我说最珍惜“什么”，我爱你的“ 存在”…

2. 我也不能告诉你“什么情况”下我“不爱”你，因为付出的爱是永远收不回来的。若是要我说“什么情况”下我“ 不能爱你那么多”，就是在我们最不能互相信任的那时刻…

3. …假设性问题我最不敢回答，因为情况天天与众不同。

但若你曾经有过有性无爱的一夜情，若你不在乎，我也不会追究。因为我相信你那时也不想伤害任何 人。

但若你现在有着有性无爱的一夜情…我会觉得很失败…因为我给不到你那一份交和的满足感。

<b>If A Woman (#1) Ask You These 3 Questions, How Would You Answer? </b>
1. What do you love about me?
2. In what situation that you&apos;ll not love me?
3. If I were to have a no-strings-attached-one-night-stand (i.e. Only sexual relationship with no love attached to it), what will you do?

<b>My Reply:</b>
Oh GOD! These questions are TOUGH!

My answers would be as follows:

1. I can&apos;t tell you "what" I love about you, because the things that I love about you can&apos;t be told in a few words. But if you were to ask me "what" I treasure the most, I love your "existence"…

2. I also can&apos;t tell you "in what situation" I will "not love" you, because love that has been given can&apos;t be taken back. But if you were to ask me "in what situation" I "can&apos;t love you that much", it&apos;s during the time when we can&apos;t trust each other the most…

3. Of all questions, I dare not answer the "if" questions the most, because everyday is a different day.

But if you were to have a no-strings-attached-one-night-stand in the past, if you don&apos;t mind, I will not ask as well. Because I trust that you also don&apos;t want to hurt anyone at that time.

But if you were to have a no-strings-attach-one-night-stand now…. I will feel that I had failed you… because I can&apos;t give you that pleasure… of blending both our heart and soul….
