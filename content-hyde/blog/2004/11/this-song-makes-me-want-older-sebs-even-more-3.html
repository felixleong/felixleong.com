{% mark post -%}<b>NOTHING&apos;S GONNA TAKE MY LOVE FROM YOU / KAREN</b> (from SEB18)
(Also covered by Nuage and D&D [Retitled as In Your Eyes])

Watching you this morning
Everything is shining
What a joy to have you
By my side

Turn your head and tell me
"I just need to hold you"
Let me see your loving
In your eyes

* Eyes that give me passion now as they
Call me thru the night
Nite that till tomorrow shines in my heart
Just to tell ya

** Nothing&apos;s gonna take my love from you babe
Anything that matter now is today
I would never let you go believe it
I wanna take and deceive (sic.) it

Nothing&apos;s gonna take my love from you now
Nothing&apos;s gonna hide the moon of this nite
I would never change my mind and leave you
And nothing&apos;s gonna take my love from you

Easy like a rainbow
Stormy like a tiger
That&apos;s our love and always
I&apos;ll be there

Make me feel another
Treat me like a flower
Get me to be stronger
With your eyes

* Repeat

** Repeat
