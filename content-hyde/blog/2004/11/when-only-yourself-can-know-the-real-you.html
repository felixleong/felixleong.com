{% mark post -%}Just some recap of past events:
- Just finished my numerical analysis computer programming assignment, now what I need is to run a few tests, debug, and I&apos;m done with it :3
- Been chatting with Johnson just now, and he pretty much talked about work related stuff. But somehow we drift into some deep philosophical thoughts that really interest me. I&apos;m keep them in my head for Today&apos;s Drifting Thought ideas :p.

As a footnote, I&apos;m not going to touch any real alcoholic drinks anymore (unless on special occasions), since I have pretty much 101% sure that I definitely can&apos;t stand even less than one glass of beer to get drunk (at least physically). Honestly with my sensitivity/allergies with most thing with an -ol appended at the back of it, make it alcoholic drinks or perfume, I suppose it doesn&apos;t came to me as a big surprise.

But then again… I still love my shandy (Less than 1% alcohol) and wine chocolates though. Talk about double standards here :p. Anyway, just wish someone would understand what I&apos;m trying to say here ;).

Anyway, it&apos;s getting late now and I have class in the morning tomorrow. So *yawn* 　おやすみなさい！＾＾　(Heh… putting what I learned in my Japanese class into action :p){%- endmark %}
