{% mark post -%}I think I overworked my legs today for all the walking and dancing. Now I&apos;m experiencing some serious leg cramps and muscle pain. Ouch!

Second thing of the day, during a chat session with my friends, they brought up the girlfriends issues and joke and someone remarked about gays and stuff. I can&apos;t believe that no one suspect that my bisexuality. Hmm… I wonder whether that&apos;s a good thing ._.".

Class at 9 tomorrow, classes aplenty, but the good thing about it is having Choon Hui around. …Just hope that he didn&apos;t avoid me like plague if I ever got the courage to ask him… I can&apos;t even think of bringing myself to ask in an indirect manner. Gotta head for bed.{%- endmark %}
