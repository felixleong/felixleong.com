{% mark post -%}Darn! A lonely night like this does kinda make me feel obsessive-compulsive again. For those who didn&apos;t get the message: I&apos;ve been missing Choon Hui only 6 hours not seeing him x_x". But it seems lately he get pretty close with me, which does make me feel… well, loved. (I&apos;m melting now)

But I suppose it&apos;s only a friendly gesture than anything else, well… but I would never know if I never asked. Ah… the dillema :p.

OK, must think of someway of keeping myself occupied.

[*note: for the uninitiated, CODS = Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome. OK, I made that one up anyway.]{%- endmark %}
