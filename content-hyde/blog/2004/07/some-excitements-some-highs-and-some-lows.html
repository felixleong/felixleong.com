SQUEEEEE~

Anyway, I just can&apos;t get bored with the CD, so that does worth the hefty 2900 Yen. (ouch! x_x")

Have some fun chat with Erika and Su Hu today, they are always great chat partners :).

For some reasons, I just feel a little bit blue today. Partly due to Steven&apos;s words, well… Somewhat he made me sound like I&apos;m some sort of shopaholic. OK, I DO admit that my overspending habit ought to be shot, but his words does hurt me quite a lot. Well… no surprise though, since the CD does cost <b><i>THREE times</i></b> more compared to CDs bought locally (and most family and friends consider it as a waste of money). Come on! Someone does have to support their favourite artists, right?

Secondly… well… I didn&apos;t manage to have much a involved conversation with Choon Hui, which does made me a little bit empty inside. Oh shit… I think I have been going through a really repeating cycle here. x_x"{%- endmark %}
