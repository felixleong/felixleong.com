{% mark post -%}Darn! Sometimes I just hate myself X(. You know, being absent-minded, have absolutely no sense of direction (especially when it&apos;s a car), getting all frustrated over things which is beyond my control, and having a totally fragmented brain when I get panicked or guilty over something. I just hate my own shortcomings.

<u><b>Longer story:</b></u> (Which is pretty much fragmented which reflects my current thoughts X( )
Went to Time Square with a friend today, then we go separate ways due to the fact that we are going to do different stuff. Have fun in the arcades, but didn&apos;t notice that my network has no coverage in my phone and my phone ran out of juice later on. Went home alone since I can&apos;t get through his cell using a public phone, and on my way back home, I happen to stumble upon Jacob and have dinner and chat pretty long with him.

Pluggin&apos; in my phone, my friend seems to be really worried since he had sent tons of messages. Then I called him back, and he said that he&apos;ll come over with a few friends (one of them wants to return some books back), then they ask me whether there&apos;s a place nearby which sells porridge (one of them is sick), and I said that there might be one, but I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s open. They said "Hop on!", which I did, but I should have trust my instincts that I KNEW the roads over that area is SO badly planned that I have no idea how to get there without me shuffling through my fragmented thoughts (since I&apos;m still feeling guilty and panicked there). Gave out some really bad directions and ending up having them dropping me back home with all of them feeling frustrated.

Ah crap! I can&apos;t even make sense of what I&apos;m rambling up there! *dies*

That&apos;s perhaps why I prefer to do pretty much everything on my own, at least I don&apos;t have to worry about others. But then again, I don&apos;t want to do everything alone ;_;… I really wished that some people is willing to go shopping with someone who always tends to get lost (read: me), I really wished to go to the book stores with a friend who doesn&apos;t mind to spare hours just to be in there (I know most of them won&apos;t), I really wished that someone will accompany me to have lunch and dinner together, I really wished that I can have someone to share the burden together, I really wished that it&apos;s OK to have fragmented thoughts and speech… T-T

By far, I think I did have those great friends, but now every one of them seems so far away from me… I really wanted a close friend now… someone who is able to accept who I am and vice versa… (for some reason, Choon Hui pops up in mind… but then again… ;_;).

OK… that did relieve some of my frustrations. Anyway, day 2 is pretty much… OK, nothing happened except that I forgot that no one is going to switch on the lights at night. Thank god I manage to get back home at 8pm. A few more school stuff is due tomorrow, which did add on to my frustrations…

Crap… I just wish that I can take things easy and calmly…{%- endmark %}
