{% mark post -%}&lt;rant&gt;
Since when my manga tutorial site has been taken down?!!! >=O (http://felixleong.freewebsites.com/) As much as I haven&apos;t update it like years, that does mean that they can just erase my files without any explanation!
&lt;/rant&gt;

*huff puff*

Anyway, I&apos;m reuploading the stuff back to the server, but I suppose I might as well think of an update soon since I do have tons of artwork lying around in my hard drive.

On a unrelated note, all of a sudden I feel a bit helpless again. Oh great, why this always have to happen when I set my eyes on someone. T-T Rushing for my next lecture now.
