{% mark post -%}Well, not really. My CDRom hates the first track (Body feels EXIT) a lot, making me unable to listen nor rip the track ;_;… not to mention the CDRom cause two minor scratches on the CD. NOOOOOOO~~~!!! >.<"

The next best alternative is either my desktop which runs on Linux (but I can&apos;t rip it there), or the included player in the CD. (which has better 128Kbps encoded songs, compared to many avex CCCD I owned) But the other tracks just happily reside on my notebook now, so I guess I have to ask a friend to help to get that track out.

Anyway, to my surprise, there are THREE Eurobeat covers in Namie&apos;s 181920: Try Me ~Watashi o Shinjite~ (Original by Lolita), Taiyou no SEASON (I don&apos;t know the original song) and Stop The Music (Original by Sophie). Try Me did got me a shock, I didn&apos;t like it during the first run XD. OK, obviously there&apos;s NO way anyone can mimic Eurobeat artists vocals, especially when it comes to Lolita&apos;s. But after listening to it a couple of times, it&apos;s a great song by it&apos;s own right ^^v. I definitely love Stop the Music, and she captured the same spirit as Sophie&apos;s original, making me instantly hooked. Now I found myself liking the cover and the original ^^. Out of curiosity, Namie&apos;s Stop The Music has somewhat arranged in the same way like how SEB100 sounds (and as most of you might have knew, SEB100 contains all songs mixed non-stop!). :p

The other tracks are pretty great as well, I personally liked Body feels EXIT and CAN YOU CELEBRATE? a lot (and my CDRom hates it ;_;). A walk in the park is also great, the other tracks are pretty decent as well, not to mention that the music spans to a lot of different genres, making it one refreshing CD to listen to. I haven&apos;t tried the DVD included (I need a DVD player ;_;), I suppose I might as well wait for a while. Too bad they don&apos;t have any PVs for ALL Eurobeat covers in the CD. How dare they! Darn avex! T-T

Anyway, one of my better friends have came to PJ from Sabah! Oh great! It&apos;s been a while I haven&apos;t seen him… the problem is that he&apos;s not free and he will be going back soon. Aww… shucks! On a side note, It&apos;s kinda embarrassing unable to identify his voice when he called me just now. Oh god…

Later on, I went to Time Square with some PPP fun. When I went there, it seems that there&apos;s an JGTC expo held over there, well… I&apos;m not that into motor sports, but I suppose those who are can imagine all those cool cars displayed over there for people to drool on. And just before I head home, the JGTC race queens are taking photographs for the press… and OMG! Did I saw Ryoko and Tomomi there O_O"? Well… I don&apos;t really believe my eyes, but there are two of those race queens who looked like them. "Tomomi" has the PPP1 hairstyle while "Ryoko" has the one like PPP4, but I don&apos;t really think it&apos;s them because that "Ryoko" looks a little bit younger while "Tomomi"&apos;s eyes are pretty much… different. Maybe it&apos;s just me…

But then, if they ARE Ryoko and Tomomi… *stab self* ;_;. Well… for one thing, I&apos;m not too sure (sorry, no pics since I didn&apos;t have a camera with me >.<"). Perhaps I might as well check the papers tomorrow (hopefully there&apos;s a picture or two regarding the event). Err… perhaps they are Vivace? (But then again, I have NO idea how the Vivace members looked like either.{%- endmark %}
