{% mark post -%}As said, just to avoid stalkers (real ones), I just put the "home alone" entries as friends-only ;).

Anyway, my aunt left to the airport at 8 in the morning, so that pretty much marks the beginning of this. Kind of remind me of the movie "Home Alone" when I was a kid, I liked the first two of it (and 3 being bad while 4… just doesn&apos;t seem to worth it anyway). But that does marks the beginning of me undertaking new responsibilities: I have to return home early to make sure that the lights are switched on, having those oil lamps (for our Chinese prayers) filled, taking out the trash, locking the gates *yada yada yada*. Not to mention that I have to wake up early as well to unlock the gates. Tedious work, I would say.

I wouldn&apos;t that it&apos;ll be fun, but at least I had a little bit more freedom, well… at least I can switch on more lights now (my aunt is a nag when she knew that I&apos;m trying to brighten the place up a little).

Planning to film a few videos tomorrow, and I&apos;m looking forward to that ^^b. But for now, I might as well take care with my schoolwork first.{%- endmark %}
