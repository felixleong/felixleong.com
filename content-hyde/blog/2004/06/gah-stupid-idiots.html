{% mark post -%}GAH! I JUST HATE SICK PEOPLE TALKING CRAP!!! I GET SO UPSET WHEN I READ ALL THESE CRAP FROM THIS GUY!!!

Hi all,

For your information, we are a bunch of students here, our group consist of some guys and some gals. Some of us might be in the same class or course with you and some might not. Who we are is not important but what we got to offer is what you should concern! Now we would like to let everyone knows that we can help you all do your AAI&apos;s tutorials, but for a price of course.

Why do we charge for doing programs? Then let me ask you back. Do you guys or gals want to get ZERO mark for:
-not finishing your tutorial?
-having some program that can&apos;t compile?
-being caught you copying someone else&apos;s program?
-not able to explain or understand the code that you copied from someone else?

Well, I can say that most of the asnwer I will get is DAMN F**KING BIG NO!. So, is this enough to convince you guys on what we got to offer? As you all know, we are a bunch of students and we got our own tutorials and lectures, so, to do your tutorial, we need to squeeze out some of our precious time and do you expect us to do this without any compensation? Well, our compensation here comes in monetary term.
(We have our right to earn some pocket money, don&apos;t we?)

So, lets get down to business here, shall we? For the pricing we are still discussing about it among ourself. But in our initial discussion, we had agreed with the price for one tutorial might be varied from RM5 to RM10, all depend on the difficulties and demands. This means that the more difficult and the more demand we got, we
might increase the price accordingly. Too steep? Don&apos;t worry, we still haven&apos;t concluded yet but that will be our price for now.

As for our program, we can guarantee that each program we going to code will be unique to avoid detection from your tutor(s). We will treat each work as individual work and will code it from ground up. Since there is more than 1 person in our group, we have a big pool of ideas and creativity to make this a reality. Even if the tutor know
that you can&apos;t be doing this program, he/she can&apos;t find any evidence that will indicate from where you get that programs.

In one of our (not with you, dung-head!) previous discussion, one of our &apos;programmer&apos; mentioned that the tutor would find out that the program is not done by you when they start asking question about the source code. Well, worry no more because we have our solution here. We can provide comment in our code to facilitate your understanding in the works that we done. The comment that we included would be easily to understand unless you are a real dung-head. If commenting inside
the code still don&apos;t provide adequate helps, we still can provide online tutoring to explain each line of code to you. If there are 1000 lines, we will still explain them one by one until you totally understand. Nothing in this world is free, right? Therefore, we might charge a little bit in this extra service. For now, we will only charge you RM3 for it. Well, with this online tutoring and the unique code, we can guarantee that the tutor will definitely thinks that it is your job and it would be flawless.

We, as a bunch of unknown-to-you programmers, would also like to remain anonymous and therefore we also respect our customer&apos;s privacy if they would like to remain anonymous(so, don&apos;t ask me who we are). We won&apos;t disclose any detail of our customers and the transactions we had made. This policy will ensure that no one is caught by the tutor(s) or the authority(hah?!).

As for the payment, we would appreciate if our customer could pay using some online payment system(eg. paypal). We won&apos;t accept cheque, credit card or hell bank&apos;s notes. AND we definitely WON&apos;T accept CASH. Cash smells funny and we don&apos;t like it. Anyway, method of payment can be arrange if there is some problem with what we had suggested.

Some of you might be wondering whether we are capable of doing this or not. All we can say is that we are better programmers than 98% of you all! And for the remaining 2%, you can be proud and start a new programmer-for-hire group (we don&apos;t mind having some competition here). We are not super-programmer or professional but we just found that those tutorial questions are too easy for us and we can do it.

That is all for the introduction and if you are interested, you can drop me a mail and we can start doing business.

Yours Sincerely,
programmers-for-hire


PS: To the tutor(s)/lecturer(s)of this subject, we are so sorry for this but whenever there is demand, there will always be someone there to fill it up.

Hi all,

Thanks for all the interest you guys/gals shown, especially from those best 2% in programmers in here (thanks for those swearing and shitting too). We would also like to thank some of our &apos;customers&apos; for showing your support and for your information, we are almost fully booked and can&apos;t accept anymore order for now. Please bear with us as we are only a small group here and we got classes to attend. We had never expected to have so much people rushing for the tutorial. As we had promised,
we will start coding as soon as possible and most probably by tonight when all our group member will meet.

As we can see here, there is some people here not very happy with us and had started swearing and screwing around (moderator, please do your job and control your &apos;people&apos;. thanks). First of all, we existed here because of several reasons. We also don&apos;t want to create misundersatnding among ourself and therefore we will provide
explaination to some of the interesting points that those best 2% people bought up. Here is some part of the previously posted messages and some explaination from us(we did this to clear up the air a bit):

"u think not getting 0 mark for the course work is really importance?"

- we totally agree with you that 0 mark is not important but what important now is FULL mark. I hope you get the idea of what is important now.

"this group is created to &apos;share&apos; knowledge not to &apos;sell&apos; knowledge!"
- name us something that is not valued in monetary term. Even there are people who love others for money. You gain something and you will lose something too. Nothing is free, dude.

"y u still have to pay $$ to some 1 to help u in the process of learning instead of put more effort in programming since u&apos;re computer science student."
- learning as we all know leaning does not consist of only one way. Different people got different way to learn. Some learn it without shelving extra money but to some weaker one, they have to pay the price to compensate what their weakness. Do you think failing this subject and have to pay another RM100 for the supplementary paper is a wiser choice? or paying a small amount now to have a better coursework mark and a stronger foundation to pass this subject? If you think knowledge is free, try not to settle the school&apos;s fees for next semester and we will see what is the real meaning of knowledge. Why don&apos;t you think about this first before you talk?

"i feel so sorry for ur parents as u betray urself and ur parent as well."

- well, I think nobody will feel happy either when they got zero mark in their coursework and failed this subject as the result of your &apos;cleverness&apos;. We also believe that your parent will not call you a faithful son/daughter for failing a subject.

"I agree. Maybe the grading system should be reviewed, because desperate people do desperate things. These marks are crucial for our final grade."
- this is the best message that we like most and you got our points clearly. They came to us out of desperation, not because they are stupid. They are smart because they know that these marks will greatly contribute to their final exam.

"Makes u wonder, will it come to a point where students are willing pay others to do their final year project?"
- we had got some feedback and feedforward from some of our &apos;friends&apos; and we might also consider about this offer. We will let you know when we are available for FYP in the near future.

"wat about ur future???u think ppl would hire u???"
- we do believe that there is no future too if you failed this subject and tainted your report card. Would you hire someone who failed or pass in their exam? Think about it too, dude. We know that you are the best 2% programmer we got here. So, please be considerate with other weaker programmers.

"for the previous group of ppl who&apos;s asking for money for source codesâ€¦i&apos;d say screw u!!!!!"

- if you are not happy with us, you may say it out politely. We hope the moderator would take some action on these indecent posting and not just sit there watching.

Lastly, we hope that those good programmers here don&apos;t hate us. We just exist here as there are demands and opportunities. As for some solution to this subject such as posting code and articles, all I can say is that it won&apos;t work! NEVER EVER GOING TO WORK EITHER! Those codes and articles had been lying around internet since eon of ages ago and if this works, we won&apos;t still get so much demands now.

Yours Sincerely,
programmers-for-hire

PS: we are now planning to include a new service called online tutoring, or you can call it as tuition too. Of course we will charge for tutoring, more information will be available soon.

DARN!!! And I&apos;m stupid enough to put this up in my LJ X(! SCREW THEM!!!{%- endmark %}
