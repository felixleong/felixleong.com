h-happiest day of your life: … I can&apos;t recall ;_;
I-Interests: Ouch! Here&apos;s the long list: Parapara, reading, writing, drawing manga, doing creative stuff, surfing online and snag free stuff (game music MIDIs, anyone?)

w-why do you love od: What OD?
x-xtra thing not a lot of people know about you: First of all, my sexuality, I suppose. I have been nailing my closet really shut and being bi doesn&apos;t really give any sort of comfort.
