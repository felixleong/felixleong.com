Yong Ling, me, a coursemate which I don&apos;t know his name (O_O"") and Moa Kit.

These were taken in front of the Putrajaya Convention Centre, FYI.

As for today… I don&apos;t know, I just feel tired. School has literally drain my energy to the max. Well… it&apos;s still enjoyable with friends and stuff, but I just feel totally unproductive once I get home, which is not too good.

Took my nap just now, I <i>should</i> be OK now. Computer Society membership drive booth is going to be opened tomorrow, hope it gets more response and members than last time, because it&apos;s embarrassing to see less than 20 members in the society o_O".

Signing off now. Now I just need a cure for being lethargic most of the day.{%- endmark %}
