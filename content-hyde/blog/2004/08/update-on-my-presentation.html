{% mark post -%}Just three words: The marks sucks (14/50 for our functionality part) >.<", and it&apos;s an all time low out of all my assignment marks. *dies!*

But at least the presentation went well. (as if it were any consolation)

<b>[::Shameless Request::]</b>
To all PPStagers, I need someone to edit my new videos (got three original choreographs here in my cam), and I need a place to host them up. :3

(p/s: Would appreciate if I&apos;m able to transfer the files through email because our school Internet has blocked all IMs, and web-based IM is crippled)

Last but not least, this afternoon I just feel totally… blank (if that&apos;s a good word). I don&apos;t know how should I put it… it just that, there just too many opportunities rushing to Choon Hui lately (well, he&apos;s has been the only one in the President&apos;s list for two consecutive semesters). I don&apos;t know… I&apos;m fully aware that there&apos;s a high possibility that we are going to go separate ways in the end (as in physically than anything else), but I just… can&apos;t help but feeling a little bit lonely without him. Well, it&apos;s a relief that overhearing his conversation (sorry, I&apos;m bad -_-") that things are going my way for the time being, but I still can&apos;t help but having that blank look (somber would be a better term, but I really didn&apos;t sense any negative emotions running through me) written on my face.

Oh darn I feel so like a loser now… ;-;{%- endmark %}
