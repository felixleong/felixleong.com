{% mark post -%}Due to assignments, I&apos;m not going to have a life for a few days in order to get the hell (read: assignments) out from my schedules. Ugh… I hate doing every single thing on my own when I had a group >.<". That&apos;s the "control-freak & giving-control" dilemma. (*note: Argh! Why I always stumble at this word! *note to self: should be double <i>m</i>&apos;s instead of <i>l</i>&apos;s)

But at least not all life have been sucked out from my soul, within 5 hours I&apos;m going to win another CD =3… and Choon Hui looked great in his khaki coloured, checker-patterned* shirt (since he&apos;s usually in tees). <333 Ah… just the little things which inject some fun in life.
(* I don&apos;t think this is the right word, anyone care to improve my vocab? :3)

[:: UPDATE ::]
Wee~ Just won Lolita&apos;s Try Me album from eBay <333! ^^{%- endmark %}
