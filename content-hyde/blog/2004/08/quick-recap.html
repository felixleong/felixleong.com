{% mark post -%}Nothing much except for the extreme urge to scream out of my lungs (read: assignments). Just to recap:
- Just got my haircut, and it turns out to be pretty good ^^
- The Lolita Try Me Album should be in the postal service now <333
- My Ayu-ro Mix CD hasn&apos;t arrived yet ;_____; (but then again, it&apos;s only a weekâ€¦ >.> And I&apos;m sure that I put the correct address)
- Assignments ought to be shot

Guess that&apos;s about it.{%- endmark %}
