{% mark post -%}Gahâ€¦ With some assignment due dates closing in with rapid speed, I have to force myself to keep my sleeping hours to a minimum in order to catch up with all the stuff that I had left behind. Therefore I foresee myself going to have puffy eyes REALLY soon, not to mention that I&apos;ll be living with love letters (a kind of Chinese cookie, not the real one which makes you all mushy :p) and perhaps some carbonated drinks (having PepsiX Energy Cola today) throughout the ordeal. And I&apos;ll be walking around like zombies and I&apos;m sure I&apos;m going to spend most of my classes sleeping or catching up with stuff.

Till hell ends, wish me luck that I didn&apos;t end up being zombified.{%- endmark %}
