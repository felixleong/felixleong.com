{% mark post -%}All afternoon I had spent in front of the monitor with Macromedia Flash on, and working on with my Flash project. Phew, I never knew that animating stuff can be really challenging at times, even a stepping sequence took me a lot of just to fine tune the keyframe so that it looks natural… unanimated! Basically what I&apos;m doing all day is to segment out the character into various movable parts, test the animation, fine tune that segment of artwork, test the animation… then work on another little segment.

After about a afternoon&apos;s work, now I got myself a real posable model and a partially done stepping sequence. Hopefully I can manage to finish this baby by next week or so ;).

Then at around 7pm I went for a software developer gathering, and luckily I had someone to fetch me there (Thanks Kah Fui! ;) ), however we are stuck in a traffic jam soon after. I wonder what happened today, but since Sunway (one of the place that we have to pass through in order to get to our destination) is almost typically jam most of the time, I guess today&apos;s no exception.

Then there I was in Starbucks Subang Jaya, and I was a little bit bored since I can&apos;t seem to find a conversation to slot in. But when Serena (one of the boardies in that online community) talks about the current "utilization system" in her current company, I really experience what we called as a shark infested world (or a dog-eat-dog world… or something like it). Basically the system is as such: Basically your pay is based on how "utilized" you are, which means that how long you have been working on a project which is assigned to you. However, you have to obtain your projects yourself, i.e. when a project manager posts up an assignment, you have to grab your chance or others will. Not to mention that you&apos;ve to give an estimation on how long you can finish it and your calling pay. (And they only will pay you based on your time estimation and not your actual spent time on your project! That sucks!) And at the end of the month if you utilization rate is low, your base pay will be slashed by 30%! (and having a good utilization rate will only bring you a 10% increase in your base pay) To compensate that (low utilization), the workers (irregardless which department you are in) must do sales and must reach a certain target in order to raise your utilization rate!

So it&apos;s like a warfare (or should I say… a market? Since everybody is trying to bargain through to get the job) within the company where everyone are manipulated to overwork themselves and to throw comradeship out of the window. THAT&apos;S SLAVE-DRIVING! >:( Next time I better make sure that I&apos;m not getting into one of these companies!

Other than that, I reached home near midnight, feeling a little bit awake and posted this. Till then, treasure all the freedom you had! :)
