{% mark post -%}It&apos;s about two months since I have started with LiveJournal and I have been constantly updating it, marking down the thoughts and events that I experienced during that point of time.

But what keeps me pondering isn&apos;t my posts in the past, but the Friends feature provided by LJ. For some reasons, I have been reading my friends page pretty much religiously after I had finished with my posting for the day. Then it&apos;s back in my thinking mode: why am I reading all this while my time can be better spent in doing something else? So I started to read the friends page really carefully this time, and I notice that most post are pretty much describes about what everyone&apos;s doing in their daily life. Nothing more, nothing less. It&apos;s much like life at its work.

Contrasting that with my own journal, my journal entries is pretty much self-centric: about what happened to me at the time of writing, what am I thinking or feeling, or perhaps some occasional quiz results that I got. And I did notice that I didn&apos;t really refer much about anyone apart from a few short appearance of a few "supporting characters" to go by with the current event (Compared to others in my friends&apos; page). And I&apos;m like: "Woa~ what have been everyone been reading lately (with reference with my journal)? ^_^|| "

Hmm… I not saying that it&apos;s bad or anything, looking the fact that I labelled my journal as "In Hues of Blue" and my friends&apos; page as "In Paradise of Pastels" (the reason why I put that title is that I used mostly pastel colours for the background of headings). But I put the titles pretty much literally and I never knew that I created a contrast indirectly. It&apos;s like while my journal is peaceful or sombre (or perhaps lonely at times), the friends is much more chirpier and lively (some are even crazy, but they are mostly friends-only :) ). Perhaps the sense of harmony is what I liked about my journal.

Hmm… Or maybe I should have a life instead. :)
