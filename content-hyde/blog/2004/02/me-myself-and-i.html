{% mark post -%}Just downloaded SEB145&apos;s Me, Myself and I (thanks Ahmed! :) ), just to sample and have a taste of newer Eurobeat style.

*take a deep breath, and press the play button*

After a really beautiful Japanese instrument intro (Koto… or is it something else, I can&apos;t seem to remember), I was shocked again. The changes in Eurobeat style does let me wonder about how Eurobeat should sound like. Well… I can&apos;t be blamed for feeling odd since I almost lost in a big gap, which is like… between SEB120~140-ish. Or perhaps the earlier Eurobeats (1-70-ish). Wow, SEB albums almost caught me off-guard every time I listen to them. Too bad I&apos;m totally against illegal downloads and I always try my best to get their albums to listen to it (apart from a few songs only for sampling purposes, or perhaps fan-made MIDI mixes), otherwise I might be constantly updated with the latest flow of music.

Anyway, back to the song, it&apos;s really beautiful: a good blend of Japanese music (actually I should say that Japanese music is the main supporting element in the song), dance percussions, and your faithful Eurobeat syncs. But somewhat I can&apos;t seems to link this new style of Eurobeat with the Eurobeat I use to know… perhaps I have been exposed to the faster tunes instead of the slower ones? (My SEB collection is like mostly Para Para non-stop remixes, and most of them sound… well, your typical Eurobeat wackiness and the catchy dance rhythms) Somewhat this songs does sound really mainstream-ish and I can&apos;t seem to link it with Eurobeat at all.

Hmm… Enough of my over-analysis, great song and good work, Christine! Totally swept away by your beautiful song! :D (Darn… wish I had enough cash to buy ANYTHING from CDJapan… ;_; ){%- endmark %}
