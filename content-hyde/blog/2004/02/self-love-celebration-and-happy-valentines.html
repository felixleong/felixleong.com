{% mark post -%}Ah! The joy of Valentine&apos;s Day! The day that we cherish love, especially the special other. As much I look at it as a over-hyped and over-commercialized event, it doesn&apos;t hurt to have another special day with some form of meaning, right? :)

As much it&apos;s kind of… err, odd to be alone during a day like this (well… *sigh* so far so good for someone single like me), I decided to do something enjoyable for myself. Yup, self-love is also a kind of love that most people would overlook, but nonetheless it a special kind of love that people shouldn&apos;t be lacking of. (Hey, seriously, how can you enjoy life if you don&apos;t even love yourself!)

Anyway, I decided to put some of my assignments on hold and start to design my own T-shirt for our Para Para group! :D I always wanted to try custom making my own clothings yet I always put it on hold due to the other work I had to do. But not this time! So two days ago, I spent some money to get a few brushes and a few bottles of fabric dye and started to work on it.

However, due to the fact that this is my first attempt, there are some things that I had to learn the hard way. I constantly smudged the dye on my shirt and I never knew that fabric dye SHOULDN&apos;T be used together with water (and I get some nasty colour bleeds that I had a hard time to cover them X( ). Not to mention that templates made of cardboard isn&apos;t really a good idea (It&apos;s not solid like plastic films so more often than not the flimsy cardboard template will give way to really hard strokes and dabbling). So currently my shirt is pretty much "patchy" since I have to use white dye (Thank god they had that!) to cover a lot of unintentional mistakes.

But then again, painting a custom T-shirt is really fun! That remind me of my art classes that I had in high-school. I always had problems with using brushes but more or less I got the hang of it once I started to paint it. The texture of fabric dye always remind me of poster or oil paints. I&apos;m not really keen on those, but the bold colours are really striking and it pretty suitable for illustrations.

After 2 days of labour, I have almost finished with my shirt and I&apos;m still waiting for shirt to dry (I washed the shirt just to wash out the extra layers of unused dye and make it a little bit softer). I still have to make some final touches on the shirt (especially the Para Para Paradise logo that I painted in the front!) and I&apos;m planning to wear it out tomorrow and give Tommy a little surprise (Wee~ I got a shirt for our group!)

And now, I have another possession of a result of my labour of love :). I&apos;ll post pictures tomorrow once I get the final touches done!{%- endmark %}
