{% mark post -%}Today's just one of those days that when I just got out from the house and having fun alone. :) Friends are great to hang out with, but I'd always leave some time for myself once in a while, so it'd give me a lot of ample room to walk about and pondering/thinking stuff without much worry about others.

This time I headed to Midvalley, one of my favourite spots to shop and hang out. Went to catch Wallace & Gromit - The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and enjoyed it from end to end :D. I really liked how the movie was executed, especially when you tried to notice the minor visual and dialogue details that was shown in the film… not to mention that there's a lot of innocent moments when one can really take things out of context (Ahem, hormones hormones :p). The timing of the events was definitely spot on and every single frame was definitely utilised to the maximum. Really enjoyed the fact that they manage to twist all the typical stuff into really funny gems that definitely cracks people up, not to mention how they poked fun at our own… emm, humanity :p.

The British accent is a plus :p.

Then I went buying another shirt, considering one of my Chinese New Year shirt got tainted as I tumbled it in the washing machine &gt;_&lt; (damn-I-need-a-water-filter!). But it wasn't really a bad turn of event as it did made the shirt looked more retro, but I just have to pick another shirt as:
- It wasn't really a good idea to wear polo shirts two days in a row (or at least I don't want to)
- in case my parents nags about my clothing :p.

So I got another one today, a very cool T-shirt yet not straying away from the image I had in mind. :)

As I was there, I have been putting my brains into drifting mode and basically it's much more of a review to myself :), nothing really new is going on during the thinking process (or I would have typed a drifting thought or impromptu post instead :p).

Then I went to the gym before I head home writing this entry :).{%- endmark %}
