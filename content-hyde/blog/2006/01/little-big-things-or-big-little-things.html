{% mark post -%}It's all about small things that seems big for these two days. OK, probably a big thing that seems small (to me) for yesterday :p.

For yesterday, it's really a big thing as the whole department staff is as busy as a bee handling the programming competition public lecture and presentation night (it's a prize giving ceremony with dinner at a very classy restaurant). Really brought memories as I have attended twice, but this time round I'm working instead of the one doing the receiving :p (i.e. lectures, dinner and prizes).

The main highlights of the day aren't the event itself, but what happens during it. Flashing back, I went to Genting Highland with Sze Hau and his two friends, Siao Yen and Wai Kiat (I wonder whether the spelling is right?). Siao Yen is definitely very special and somehow I did spent time observing her and her surrounding. What makes her special? Ask her wheelchair. She's a disabled person and a determined person as well. Through her I did gained some insights, that helping others is a skill that has to be learnt and the importance of certain building structures that is crucial to these people with special needs.

And indeed, helping does need training and it's not easy. Especially that getting a wheelchair up an escalator that not designed for that purpose requires a lot of effort and coordination. (We aren't left much choice about it, actually, with the lack of facilities) Looking from that perspective, I really get to experience the importance of such disabled-friendly facilities.

On a much lighter note, the dinner is definitely a blast, as the boys are dressed up smart like a man while the girls turned themselves into beautiful ladies. The magic of clothes and makeup ;). The most unforgettable experience is when the boss helped me to put on a tie ^^||. That happened after he saw me spending a long time fumbling with my tie ^^||.

As for today, been spending more time catching up. Nothing major but tons of housework pending due to my own recent circumstances. Then later on as I wanted to pay for my PPP (Arcade) Original Soundtrack and Love Para<sup>2 </sup> CD (Duh! I confess that I have been into eBay again XD), I notice that my debit card has ran out of funds X_X||. And darn PayPal insists of my getting my credit card account verified before it allows me to use it. Big DUH! Not to mention today's a SUNDAY that all banks aren't open. No problem, so I thought, as there's an automated cash deposit machine at a branch opposite of my house. And guess what? It chose not to function today!

So~ Went out to a cash deposit machine hunt. Failed miserably, that's all I have to say. Bleh~ that means that I have to go to the bank tomorrow. Guess sometimes I do take some bank facilities for granted. But then again, shouldn't major bank branches have one cash deposit machines? I get to see more cheque deposit machines everywhere, but no cash deposit machines? Hmmâ€¦ I wonder why?

And finally I got all my videos in my photo collection encoded ^-^v. It's hard work indeed, but having more space for more photographs in my hard disk is definitely worth it (Motion JPEG files are a hog of space). And now my portable hard drive doubles as my photo album now, so that my family can view it this CNY. They have been pestering for photographs from me, but it's definitely understandable because I never said much about my own life here: from day one I stepped into a different realm :).

And so that's my day! Now I need to iron some shirts :).{%- endmark %}
