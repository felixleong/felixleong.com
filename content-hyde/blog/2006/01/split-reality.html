{% mark post -%}Feeling as if I have lost direction: Unable to proceed, yet unable to turn back either. Mixed signals, jumbled up information everywhere… As if I have no idea what's going on around me.

Is it the changes around me that I'm unaware of? Or is it an illusion of my creation? Or is it that I see things differently nowadays…?

A very confused mind indeed… that I really don't know what shall I do next. x_x||
