Yet another silent month, not to mention that it's my birth month as well.

Looking back, it's really not some very life shaking compared to August and September as things are starting to fall in place. But I'm starting to notice my old habits in dealing with relationship issues are getting back at me. It really gave me a glimpse of my own fears and weakness, OK, probably <strong>NOT</strong> just only a glimpse. *see parts of myself crumbling down*

This month also have seen myself starting to explore about personal responsibility, at least fragments of it, as well as self awareness. The latter is pretty much influenced by Osho's work, but during those times it really gave me a sense of empowerment. Well… although I admit that it's much easier to be self aware during the high times than the times when I feel like I'm in the slumps.

In other news, I get computer crazy this month as I bought some Internet real estate off from Sze Hau, converting to Fedora Core 4 (read: Linux), getting a graphics tablet and a notebook hard drive casing, which does equates to a VERY serious cash outflow on my part.

And let's not forget to mention the fun trip to Port Dickson as well! :D Really hope that we get to have more of these outings next time! :D

Hmm… also a month without much entries for myself to talk about. But here comes December: The final month of 2005 (I just SOOO have to say this :p).

But, saying so, honestly speaking, it is not that I forget to type entries during this month, but just that I don't feel like writing entries during that month. Why? Well… Somehow there are some feelings and events which I find to be so repetitive and trivial that I really feel that there's no point for people seeing me harping on the same issues again and again. So during those times, I say to myself "OK, why not just <strong>DEAL</strong> with it instead?". And so I did. But apparently I didn't see the effect of that. Well, probably that can only be seen in months to come, I suppose?

So at those times, I try to keep my entries as short as possible, and only type long ones as necessary. And so that pretty much sets the format of my LJ during that time.

Looking back, it's really a time when my emotions and feelings are much more raw than processed… well, more half-done than raw, actually. But saying so, I get more unconscious mood flings from time to time, it's only until I reviewed it now that I noticed this. So… ^-^|||| I really have to work on that one.

But generally, it has been a very fun month :): Vivian's wedding, Christmas celebration in the office and the karaoke lounge, getting broadband at home…

And later on, at the end of the month: The yearly review :).

Phew… I'm done :).{%- endmark %}
