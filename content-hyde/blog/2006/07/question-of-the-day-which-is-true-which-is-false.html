{% mark post -%}Somehow, think about what I have written in the past, somehow I was under the impression that I perceived that our own perception may not be that reliable as a source of the truthâ€¦ sometimes thinking that it might be completely false, even (i.e. the Illusion).

So, thinking about it, what makes something true? What makes something false? Social identification and recognition doesn't make something true. Experience doesn't make something completely true. Belief, as said, is just a mere hypothesis (or on the extreme end, it can be a baseless hope). Perception is a stimulation of our own senses, which is a partial truth to what we are living in.

Maybe it's a good time to ponder things through deeply, hmm? :) (possibly some good drifting thought material){%- endmark %}
