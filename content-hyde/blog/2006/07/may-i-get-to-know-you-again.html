{% mark post -%}Something that I really have to admit: I'm bad at remembering people in general. Or more specifically, I can only remember those who are pretty close to me and most acquaintance will pretty much have forgotten almost instantly.

Personally, in order for me to really know somebody, I just need some sort of connection. You know, breaking the ice, talking or interacting with each other and getting to know a bit of the individual does help in forging the memory of someone else.

Sometimes… well, if something was to be recalled, it really has to go into specifics, like something I would definitely REMEMBER XD.

Well, but it's great to know and meet somebody who have some sort of connection in the past. And if either one of us can't recall this kind of connection in the past, probably the question I would ask is that… "May I get to know you again?" … and hope that this time it will not be just a forgotten memory. :){%- endmark %}
