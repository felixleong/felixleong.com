{% mark post -%}Just now I have been clearing up my stuff again, paper stuff always have the capability to scatter all around the place when I least notice it, mostly bills, fliers, randomly scribbled notes… well, mostly rubbish, if that's a good way to put it ^-^||.

But somehow I just have that really uncomfortable feeling thinking whether my life have became just a mere bank balance while I'm sorting my papers. Thinking into extremes, if my life just constitute of working, spending money just to keep myself survive and entertained… ugh…

Really, if that's the case, it's not a life worth living. Just draining my life sources like that for another 50 years (give or take), that's really a scary thought.

Come to think about it… people pretty much always like to brush questions like that with a typical "Get a life" remark. But what is the thing that we call it "life"? Going out to have myself entertained is definitely not a "life", go travelling is a good way to explore different horizons but that doesn't make it a "life". Do something that would make me "happy" and "meaningful"? Somehow the core meaning of "happiness" and "meaning" are so vague that up until now I only have glimpses of it but never the full picture.

Sometimes that does really made me wonder whether people really understood the real meaning of "Get a life".

… But I suppose there's no harm to try and go experimenting with different experiences. I'm not really sure, but it's something that I'd really want to figure out :).{%- endmark %}
