{% mark post -%}Feeling screwed up over several matters these days. Nothing pretty major or of a matter of survival, just some leisurely or regarding luxury matters (read: predominantly physical possessions and financial stuff), but still I'm feeling at a loss somehow.

Change and the apprehension of it is still the main theme at the moment… probably future planning as well.

Well, it's like: I have my dreams, goals and objectives, and on the other hand, I had my needs and wants. It's kinda like a "mid/long-term" vs "short term" face-off. From time to time, achieving these mid/long-term goals aren't as easy as we'd believe it to be. Sometimes, the environment changes, our surrounding changes, thing changes that our needs may be more demanding as before. But probably that's not the main point.

What really worries at the moment is that… there's a lot of things that I wanted. From time to time, I always revise this list on my head and during these times, I'm like… whether my life is just… accumulating things…?

…

Speaking of which, this reminds me of an advice from a friend "sometimes that we don't need to really insist of getting what we want, knowing and being able to able to adapt, be flexible and willing to change will open oneself to different possibilities".{%- endmark %}
