{% mark post -%}I got this small, invisible wound on the tip of my tongue that I can't talk or eat without feeling slight tinges of pain. &gt;_&lt;||

So pretty much I tried to keep my speech as frugal that I can make it to be.

This is really annoyingâ€¦ I really hoped that it'd heal soon.{%- endmark %}
