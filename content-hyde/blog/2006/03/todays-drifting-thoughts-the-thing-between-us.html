{% mark post -%}Not really feeling much at ease lately… like… feeling unnatural, somehow.

Honestly speaking I just felt like I was treated… differently. On the outset, everything is pretty much the same, yet I do have a feeling that both of us knew that there's something between us and it's really not the same anymore.

… And that really made me anxious, it's really like I'm groping in the dark without any sort of direction.

*sigh* Being human isn't easy, is it?

Anyway, I'll be taking the bus home back to my hometown later. We'll be visiting our ancestor's graves on Sunday for Qing Ming, and judging from the rainy season, I suppose it's going to be a very muddy trip indeed.

Will be back on Monday.{%- endmark %}
