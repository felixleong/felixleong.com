{% mark post -%}Total screw up yesterday! Thanks to my itchy fingers, I interrupted the progress of my ADSL modem's firmware upgrade. Now I can't access the administration panel of my modem at all.

Luckily the modem still works @_@. But GAH!!! Pet peeves of my own misbehaviour.

Now I almost got my PC configured nicely :), will be working on ideas of my own website.{%- endmark %}
