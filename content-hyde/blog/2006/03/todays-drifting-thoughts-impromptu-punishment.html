{% mark post -%}是否没有勇气的人，永远都只会被命运和自己惩罚…？
Is it that those without any courage, will always be punished by fate and him/herself…?


<b>前注：[Foreword]</b>
听雪狼湖的原声带中陈洁仪的“原来只想共你活一天”（粤）/“祈求可以共你活一天”（国）总是很有强烈的感触，心酸和感伤。或许自己的故事和玉凤（陈洁仪的角色）真的很相似。
Everytime I listened to Nadia Chan's "I really wish to live with you for one day" (Mandarin/Cantonese) in Snow Wolf Lake musical's OST, I always had very strong emotions and sorrows. Maybe my own story is quite similar to Yu Feng's (Nadia's character) in the musical.

或许没有一个人，想要成为只能在“他”的背后偷偷瞻仰的角色。都是期盼着可以在身边互相相爱，一起走过这一段红尘吧！
Maybe no one wants to be the one who can only silently admire that special one from behind. And (we) always hoped that we can be with that person side by side, loving each other and walked the same life journey together.

…到底我要让心中那胆怯的影子保留到几时？
… For how long I want to remain in the same timid shadow?

或许连我自己也不知晓吧…
Maybe I don't know that answer myself…{%- endmark %}
