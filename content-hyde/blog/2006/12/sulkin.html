{% mark post -%}One thing that I'm pretty much aware of myself for quite some time: I tend to sulk away from the world (at least internally) when I was in a slump, and it's something that lasts for some time, depending on how despair I was.

So it's like… feeling all unmotivated at work today, maybe I should have taken leave for today :(. Dealing with my disappointment with my current situation, myself and inability to fulfill some of the things I wanted, well… it's something bearable, but still it's not really something pleasant. Well, in my opinion, anyway ^^||.

Is that I have invested too much in my own imaginations and dreams that I didn't put effort to manifest it? Well, probably. Seems likely that's one of the main factor of my disappointment. So it's like, well… I'm at a lost myself now, feeling that I had gone back to square one and understood nothing that I thought I understood.

So… I don't know what should I do next now but to keep myself balanced on the tightrope, at least it feels like that.

At least it has reminded me that good and sufficient sleep does improve my mood a lot.{%- endmark %}
