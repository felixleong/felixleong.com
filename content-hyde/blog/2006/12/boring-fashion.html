{% mark post -%}I wonder whether is it that I went shopping late or something, apparently it just seemed to me that male fashion is getting boring all of a sudden. I'm not sure whether is it because that I'm starting to become picky when it comes to clothes or that clothes for men has always been that boring, I just can't seem to find T-shirt designs that was special, in a way. Or probably it's only me didn't go to more stores or that I can't seem to find the right clothes that matches the impression that was in my mind. (to be honest, I don't have any fixed ideas on my head, I usually just depends on my instincts in some way… as long it sort of give out some sort of message I intended to)

Currently I'm wondering whether is it that the older I get, the harder it is to find clothes that matches with me? (i.e. my choice is getting more limited) But I'm just going to be 25 next year &gt;_&lt;. Somebody better tell me that this is not true ^^||.

Do I really have to end up resorting to some designer brands? But somehow the idea of spending more than RM40 for one shirt seems to be a bit too much to me… ._.||.

Meh… It's OK, guess I still have one more month to hunt around, I'm sure there must be something for me out there.{%- endmark %}
