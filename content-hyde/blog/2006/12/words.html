{% mark post -%}Feeling better now, been having a minor headache until now though -_-… I wonder whether is it because I face the radiation source way too long.

Anyway, it is reflecting time again. Rewinding back to my slump period, I'm still looking into triggers of different emotions. Somehow it's pretty interesting to how certain words were capable to trigger some strong reaction within myself (may or may not be shown, but the impact was there which does cause a behavioural change or some sort). Guess I'm not one of those people who can really swallow down negativity and strong emotions ^-^||.

Speaking of which, the year end review is coming up. Guess it's almost the time for me to prepare some long posts and hours of reading my own writings for this year. Not feeling like writing a lot this year, considering that I'm have been putting myself under a microscope all this while. But… well, we'll see how it'd turn out to be. Thinking about next year's goals… probably it won't be much different from this year, so it seemed. Not sure whether is it because I'm starting to settle down myself or just being plain lazy and unambitious ^^||.

… Probably what I should worry now is my own clothes waiting for me to iron out ^o^|||||.{%- endmark %}
