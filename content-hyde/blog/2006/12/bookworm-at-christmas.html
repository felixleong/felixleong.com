{% mark post -%}What can be more boring than spending the whole Christmas reading? Well, that's what I'm planning to do, really.

Or should I get out to resume my gym routine and finish my shopping for 2007…? But I think either way, it doesn't really matter that much, as long I have fun in one way or the other, isn't it? :) But seemed like I'm got used to being with myself? Hmm… guess that's something on how different people look at the situation, I'd probably feel that it might be a bad thing if I'm in a lousy mood XD (well… based on my own observation in the past, anyway).

Probably I might as well complete my shopping later instead of having that thought dangling in my head :).

Anyway, it's something customary, but… wish you all a merry Christmas and hope you all had happiness in store in the days ahead ;). And… it's time for me to prepare for my yearly review.{%- endmark %}
