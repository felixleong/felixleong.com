{% mark post -%}For the past few days, I have been working on my finances that I felt like an accountant :p.

The real news? My probation period is now officially over and I did get some extra money :D. But I do need to wait until my payslip arrives before I can confirm anything in black and white (as well as a basis to plan out where they should go).

Wellâ€¦ at least I don't have to worry about my emergency funds any more :), I had save enough! :D{%- endmark %}
