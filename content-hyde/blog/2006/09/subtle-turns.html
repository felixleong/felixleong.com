{% mark post -%}Yesterday I went to a property fair (yes, I do mean "real estates" alright), and the thing is that I have completely clueless when it comes to real estates and properties XD. It's like… it's a completely new thing to me, I didn't know what shall I look for even.

That pretty much made me looked like a brainless poor soul :p.

At the moment, I'm not sure what will be my future plans. There's enough subtle changes (some that I'm even aware of myself, to be honest) that I'm still finding myself adjusting to them, I guess (probably would post them in detail in my drifting thoughts posts in the future).
