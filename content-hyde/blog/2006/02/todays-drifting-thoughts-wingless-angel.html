{% mark post -%}有哪个曾经爱过的人没受过任何伤悲呢…？这个我可不晓得，只懂得自己已经不是那种人了。

曾经彻彻底底地痛哭哀嚎，曾经让自己陷入完完全全地黑暗。

…到底我自己如何捱过，我也不记得。是完全依靠天生生存的意念吗…？

至于现在，自己默默地喜欢一个他。到现在，好多好多时候，还会心生不少疑念：究竟从一般的角度来看这段感情是不可能的。

…到现在我如何捱过，我真的是不知道。只记得一次又一次的看到你的当时，一次又一次所有复杂的念头就完完全全地被沫灭掉。

好不可思议。

所以到现在自己还是那样，默默地耕耘着…即使结局已经是不可能，即使又再彻彻底底的失去，我也再所不惜。

…因为我找到了爱的存在…

How many of those who have loved before didn't experience sadness…? This, I don't know. I only knew that I'm not that already.

Cried totally before, let myself fall into a dark void before.

… How did I manage to survive, I also can't remember. Is it that I lived by my survival instincts completely…?

Coming to the present, I secretly love someone. Up until now, a lot of times, my mind still has a lot of doubts: It's not surprising that it is based on public opinion that this relationship is impossible.

… Up until now how did I manage to hold through, I really have no idea. I only remembered that every single time I saw you, that's every single time went all the complex negative thoughts get blown away completely.

Unbelievable.

Therefore up until now I'm still the same, working on it secretly… Even if the ending is known to be impossible, even if I have to lose this completely again, there's no more regrets now.

… Because I found the the existence of love…{%- endmark %}
