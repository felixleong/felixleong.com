{% mark post -%}This is really something out of the blue: I got myself a DVD writer :D. To be honest, it wasn't on my top priority list (among all my wish list items), but just happened that:
- I found that my photo collection is piling up and I'm nervous without a backup
- I'm picking up the habit to download anime :p
- Apparently this is one of the lowest priced items (excluding books and CDs) in the list

Just burned two DVDs just now and I'm glad that I have something to rely on when it comes to data backup :). But the only headache is that I still have a whole stack of blank CDRs… but well, the burner can support them anyway.

In other news, I had that feeling that chapter 6 is coming, I haven't really thought of what theme will it be as part of my own progression. I'm still waiting for that defining moment that will inspire my next transition poem.

At the moment, I'm now pondering into the "loneliness" issue, that somehow gave me an opportunity to revisit a lot of moments back into several periods in my own life. At first, the thought was a bit scary… but somehow I felt that the insight is important for me to unlock something that would give me a glimpse of who I am.

I think that's all for the moment :){%- endmark %}
