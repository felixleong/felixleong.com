{% mark post -%}An idly day today as I take two days leave from work. Didn't plan to go out anyway, so it's like… four days living in a secluded world (indoors?)? ^^||

Most of my time was spent resting (or more precisely, sleeping), but I did, in some way reluctantly, move around to carry on my daily life and performing household chores that has been delayed in the past (my surroundings were in quite a mess these days ^^||).

More important of all is that I'm sorting out my photographs in my hard drive, it's like they were already scattered around everywhere in my hard drive and I just have to reorganize them. And grouping them in one location was the easy part, the hard part is to figure out whether I had duplicates of them… with the fear that I might accidentally deleted some. I sorta got them sorted out, probably the only thing is that all the tags and favourite flags that I had set in the software has been cleared away as I have shifted all my photographs in a different location and I have to re-import the whole catalogue. &gt;_&lt;||

But… while I'm reorganize the whole set of photographs, they really brought back a lot of memories. :) And somehow it did showed how much I have changed over the years… well… in some subtle way I guess. It's much less about my physical appearance… but more on how I have acted… all the small little gestures that was taken. It's sort of a weird feeling that I had changed in many ways and yet I haven't changed a bit in some ways. I wonder whether it is appropriate for me to say "Well, I am who I am"? :p

Well… seeing that my 24th year is coming this month… I wonder how different will I turn out to be next year? Probably I will still be the same person that I am… yet I'm not? Well, who knows anyway? ^^||{%- endmark %}
