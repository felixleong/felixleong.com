{% mark post -%}As much I believe that I have repeated myself many times, I still had the same feeling of insecurity some where deep down: uncertain what the future lies. As the time my original thought of "going ahead for two years and decide what's next later" draws nearer and nearer, in some way there's an empty void there deep down… seemingly a lot of open possibilities.

Am I alone? Probably not. But it seems that from my perspective, I was. Probably in some way I have closed myself in? That's something that I'm really not sure of.

Many twists and turns in life… it does made me having the impression that my life's like a game with the outcome is a complete unknown: a mystery by its own right. What I'm sure of is that my expectations and fantasies were overturned many times.

Well… that makes a fresh new tomorrow after all.{%- endmark %}
