{% mark post -%}I'm officially going to enjoy a Internet Free Week(tm), at least when I'm at home. So don't expect to see me online when I'm back home. ;)

Knowing the fact that I will be heading back to my hometown to check the new house next week, I won't be able to enjoy much Internet anyway (in case my broadband account is back up).

So~ it's a good time for me to enjoy traditional media at the moment :). Reading books, drawing stuff, do some writing…

Till then, the only constant nagging on my head is to work things out as soon as possible to have the Internet back up. Hmm… contradictions :p.{%- endmark %}
