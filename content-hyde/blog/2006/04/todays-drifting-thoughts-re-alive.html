{% mark post -%}Fed up with the normal ho-hum life: Been rejected too many times, over analysing and reasoning too many times, been living with a heavy heart too many times.

All that hurt and pain, "for what?" I asked. All I get in return is just a false assurance that I'm still by your side and a bunch of hypothetical thoughts about you and me. And for all I know is that I'm shutting myself in that safety zone that I have never, ever seen the surroundings of your heart, let alone the door that goes there.

Being stagnant for too long, it's time to break out!

I wanted to be able to talk to you! Listen to you! Touch you! Feel you! See you! Be with you! No matter how long will it takes, I will not hesitate to take one small steps at a time to reach there.

It's time for me to move about, search for that door that goes to your heart. Even if get shattered halfway, I would rather bear that than being crushed by that cannon ball of my head.

Even I'd never be able to tell you loudly that "I love you!", I'll express that to you in other ways that it'll be heard someday.

Even if I get shattered again, it doesn't matter to me any more, because I know I have survived it until now that it's impossible for me to die easily.

Because through you, I'm starting to be able to find myself on my own.{%- endmark %}
