{% mark post -%}Oops! I did it again!

Anyway, just went to <a href="http://www.pcfair.com.my/jsp/index.jsp">PC Fair</a> just now (it's basically a very popular computer shopping cash and carry event in Malaysia). The original intent: My sister asked me to get her some MP3 players and portable storage (or also known as USB sticks/memory).

After some hours of strolling, the best deals for pure music players without all those fancy colours screens have to be these from Duraplus:
DURAPLUS D727 - RM106

DURAPLUS D788 - RM119

These little beauties are small, inexpensive, and does impressive work on MP3/WMA playing, voice recording and plays clear FM radio. Definitely recommend that you check them out straight from DURAPLUS themselves (somewhere in between Hall 3 and 4).

Then the unexpected splurge of the day which make me back in debt (well… kind of, since I opt to pay it via credit card easy payment installments :p) is this beauty that I always yearn for:

Yes! It's Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7! :D Since I checked out and compared digital cameras a few months ago, this was the camera that I have wanted :D. I have yet to test it out fully though, but I'm extremely excited with it.

But it had set me back for like… RM1700 :X, divide that into a 12-months installments/commitment… well… ^_^||. But then again, this is the plan of rewarding myself for working for one full year :).{%- endmark %}
