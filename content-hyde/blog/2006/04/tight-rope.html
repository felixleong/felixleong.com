{% mark post -%}I was pretty much on my toes the whole day just now X_X||.

First off my ADSL broadband connection suddenly went off yesterday, which all I can see my modem is that the ADSL light just kept on blinking, which really doesn't serves much of a help, really.

But I'm too tired to care about surfing, so I was thinking of leaving it alone and call the tech support later.

Then today, it had been really hectic as there's a ISO certification meeting tomorrow and there's some last minute issues, hitches and glitches that really made me running round the office in full circles to iron things out.

Then there's just many work related stuff that I needed to catch up, which is really stressful and I don't really feel like elaborating. All I knew is that I kept on cursing "Bloody hell!" like no end ^^||.

And now? I <i>just</i> came back from the office, to be honest. And the funny thing is that after I turn off the power of my modem and switch it back on, it's back to normal again.

That's a sign of relief :).{%- endmark %}
