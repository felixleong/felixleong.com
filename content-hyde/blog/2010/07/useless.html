It's easy to dream.

It's easy to prepare and work towards your dream.

However, have that feeling of immense fear that holds you back from pulling the trigger? It happens especially at times when you'd gathered all the resources, waiting just a “yes” from you; it happens when the star are all lined up and waiting for you to take that first step; it happens when that opportunity of a life time had arrived and waiting for you to accept it.

At that moment, you just freeze there: unable to respond immediately as you'd thought you'd. A sense of overwhelming fear gushing within: it's not just the fear of failure – where you imagine scenarios that you'd screw up somewhere along the way of claiming your ultimate prize; it's also the <a title="A great article from Steve Pavlina on the subject matter" href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2004/12/fear-of-success-what-will-happen-if-you-succeed/">fear of success</a>, the “what if I couldn't handle <em>[a change in life]?</em>” or even worse “what if I lose it all in the end?”.

It's funny that we'd hope that someone else who actually pull that trigger on us. That would certainly save ourselves from our internal jeopardy.

Unfortunately, the only person who could do that for you is usually yourself. After all, such a wish is an excuse to abstain personal responsibility towards yourself and you'd have someone to blame for if your dreams didn't turn out to be as good as you imagined.

So, are you going to pull the trigger and <a title="Crush It! book by Gary Vaynerchuk" href="http://crushitbook.com/">crush it</a>?{%- endmark %}
