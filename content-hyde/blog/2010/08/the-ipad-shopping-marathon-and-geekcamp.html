{% mark post -%}Just to make damn sure that I could get my hands on an iPad, this is what I ended up with:

<a href="http://upload.felixleong.com/2010/08/iPadShopping.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2449 alignnone" title="iPad Hunting Map" src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2010/08/iPadShopping-212x300.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" /></a>

The worst case scenario would mean that I'm embarking on a journey as epic as The Amazing Race: the distance itself to visit every store could add up to a full marathon, if not more.

â€¦ or maybe it's wake-up call that I need more friends who could help me buy it from Apple Online Store instead?

If you had noticed, I'll be attending <a title="Geekcamp Singapore" href="http://geekcamp.pbworks.com/">GeekCamp Singapore</a>, which will be held at Singapore Management University on 4 September 2010. I'm totally excited about it seeing the list of topics that were covered: from face recognition to iAds.

Looking forward to see you there! :){%- endmark %}
