# Hyde implementation of felixleong.comPreviously hosted as a Wordpress blog -- here's comes my Hyde implementation with static HTML generating goodness!# CaveatsOn a fresh instance, you'll need to execute `hyde gen` twice: the first execution will fail but the first-run will generate the blog tags HTML files,and hyde will be able to generate the site proper after that. # Credits and copyright noticeThe theme in use is [Mainstream](http://www.woothemes.com/2009/07/mainstream/) by [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/), with some theme elements are stripped away based on my usage.  # URL Structure- / - Listing of the most recent blog posts- /feed/ - ATOM feed of the blog- /feed/pages/[pageno] - Pagination for the feed- /blog/[year]/[month]/[pagename].html - The blog post entries- /blog/tags/[tagname] - The tag listing- /blog/pages/[pageno] - Pagination of the listing page- /manga-tutorial/ - My tutorials on drawing manga- /\*.html - Static pages
