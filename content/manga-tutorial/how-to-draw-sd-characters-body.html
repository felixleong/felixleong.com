<p>As you know, the head alone doesn't make the character complete (unless he or she has been beheaded by a guillotine, but that's another story).</p>
<p>So in this tutorial, you'll learn about drawing the body of a SD character. No, don't tell me you can't do it! It wasn't THAT hard! I'll show you some proven techniques in drawing them!</p>

<h3>How should a SD character look like</h3>
<img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/2head.jpg" alt="2-head Proportion" title="2-head Proportion" width="151" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-46" /><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/3head.jpg" alt="3-head proportion" title="3-head proportion" width="123" height="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-47" />
<p>Basically, in art, we measure the height of a character not by inches or centimeters, but how many "heads" (i.e. the ratio between the head and the entire character's height). A usual anime hero will have a ratio of 7-8, but in SD characters, there are two common conventions: A ratio of 2 or a ratio of 3. (See pic.)</p>
<p>As you can see, both of them are cute; but I'll only concentrate on one in this tutorial: the "3-head-ratio" character. (The other one needs extra practice because you have to "squeeze" or "compress" the body without making the character odd-looking) But after you have master the techniques, just use any conventions as you please.</p>
<p>Here are some features of a SD character's body:</p>
<ul>
<li>They look shorter.</li>
<li>Joints and muscles are not emphasized (most of the time).</li>
<li>Fingers are simplified, or omitted.</li>
<li>Hands are usually represented by using a circle.</li>
<li>You can hardly see the neck! (sometimes)</li>
</ul>
<p class="tutorial-goodPractice">Note: Remember that you don't have to follow these rules, add some or trash some to suit your needs. Sometimes, rules are meant to be broken :).</p> 
<h3>Step-by-step tutorial</h3>

<p>The first thing you must do is to draw a draft. Remember those stick figures you always draw in kindergarten?</p>
<p>Yeah, they look childish, but it is an excellent way to draft your character. So let's modify that a little. Now, draw a big circle as the head, then draw circles to represent joints and the pelvis. Also, draft out the hands and feet. If your character bends their arms and legs, <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">use curves instead of joint.</span> Using curves will be more flexible than using joints, hence make your character more natural.</p>
<p><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">(*Note: Take note that this step is crucial. This will help you in reviewing your character beforehand [and make your life easier, too].</span><span class="tutorial-badPractice">Ignoring this step carries the "endless loop of drawing and erasing" risk. Well, better be safe than sorry, right?)</span></p>

<p>Now, you have the draft, so you can draft the outline of the body. Use basic geometric shapes sparingly, especially circles and ovals. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Don't forget to draw the eye position cross, and the center line of the body. This step will help you in checking whether the character is well balanced or not.</span></p>

<p>Draw out the face, <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">then roughly draw out the basic costume without adding details to it.</span> Again, this will help you in reviewing. You don't want to end up being frustrated because you've wasted a lot time designing the costume, right?</p>
<p>At this point, some may argue that flesh should be drawn first. But since we have the draft, we can leave that afterwards (IMHO, of course).</p>
<p>One point to note that <span class="tutorial-badPractice">DON'T draw costumes that "stick" on the character's body (i.e. joining the line between the body and the clothing)</span>. Even it is tight, the costume has some thickness, so they don't "stick" on the body entirely.</p>

<p>Then, draw out the arms, legs, hands, and legs (or any exposed flesh).</p>
<p><span class="tutorial-badPractice">About the hands, don't draw the fingers one by one: frankly speaking, they looked ugly if you didn't draw it right.</span><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Instead, draw the hand and fingers as a whole, add lines for fingers afterwards.</span></p>
</div>

<p>For the last step, draw out the details of the costume.</p>
<p>Add some wrinkles to the costume (if it is made of cloth) if you want to, <span class="tutorial-badPractice">but not too much, they will make your picture messy.</span> (Your judgment will be a good judge for this)</p>
<p>Drawing wrinkles needs a lot of practice to master it, but that is the key to draw realistic characters. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Observation will help you a lot in drawing impressive wrinkles</span>, so dig out your comic collection, or any photographs and try to practice with it.</p>

A complete SD character!(and if you succeed, rejoice! Reward yourself for that!) Now, remember: drawing isn't an easy task, try to practice as much as you can to improve your skills (and have fun at the same time ^_^).</p>
<p>Now, why not you ink and color your picture then?</p>{%- endmark %}
