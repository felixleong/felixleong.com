This is because eyes plays an important role in expressing the character. Not only you have to make sure that the eyes are balanced, you also have to draw out the eyes to show the emotion of the character. Yeah, hair might be tedious to draw; but mastering it wasn't that hard compared to eyes.</p><p>So, let's get started!</p><h4>Pointers:</h4><p><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Good tips, tricks and techniques are in BLUE</span><br /><span class="tutorial-badPractice">Common pitfalls, errors, and disasters in RED</span></p><h3>Different types of eyes and eyebrows</h3><p><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/sampleeyes.gif" alt="Various shapes of eyes" title="Various shapes of eyes" width="250" height="242" class="alignright size-full wp-image-71" />Before we start, it is better for us to know some different types about eyes. Now, as shown in the picture on your right, eyes can take different shape and sizes. Before you say that drawing eyes are very complex, inspect the picture carefully.</p><p><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Notice that I've drawn an outline around the eyes, and you'll be surprised that these shapes looks awfully like polygons!</span> That means that you don't need to be afraid when you are drawing eyes, it is quite simple to draw (although hard to master :P)</p><p>Talk about the shape of the eyes, they can range from circles to hexagons, anything that have more sides than a hexagon is uncommon in anime drawing. So, when you start to draw or design eyes for your character, <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">knowing the shape of the eyes will help you a lot in drafting the eyes.</span></p><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/samplebrows.gif" alt="Sample eyebrows" title="Sample eyebrows" width="150" height="107" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-70" /><p>The same applies for eyebrows: it also take different shape, color, and sizes.</p><p class="tutorial-steps">You can divide eyebrows into two types:</p><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/basic4.gif" alt="Smooth vs jagged eyebrow flow" title="Smooth vs jagged eyebrow flow" width="150" height="47" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-65" /><p><strong>1. The &quot;Streamlined&quot; eyebrows:</strong> The most commonly used. It can be a straight line, a "hill", or a "small wave" (like this one).</p><p><strong>2. The &quot;Jagged&quot; eyebrows:</strong>Usually these kind of eyebrows are used for characters who have an exceptional personality. Many villains have these kind of eyebrows, <span class="tutorial-badPractice">but usually not females!</span></p><h3>Difference between male and female eyes</h3><p>Here's also a point to note when drawing eyes for different genders:</p><p class="oat"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/male.gif" alt="Male eyes sample" title="Male eyes sample" width="150" height="222" class="alignright size-full wp-image-68" /><strong>For males:</strong><br /> Eyebrows are thicker, no eye lashes, and usually the eyes are smaller than females.</p><p class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/female.gif" alt="Female eyes sample" title="Female eyes sample" width="150" height="160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-67" /><strong>For females:</strong><br/> Thin eyebrows, eye lashes are thicker, and the eyes are bigger compared to males.</p><p class="tutorial-steps"><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">These rules aren't fixed as different characters have different personalities and you'll have to break some rules for that.</span> E.g. An adventurous woman (e.g. Lara Croft) will have thicker eyebrows.</p><div class="tutorial-note">*NOTE: The size of the eyes looked almost the same in the samples given here. But with careful inspection, you'll notice that the eyes of the females takes up a larger area compared to males.</div><h3>Step-by-step guide</h3><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step11.gif" alt="Step 1: Draft the shape for size" title="Step 1: Draft the shape for size" width="150" height="141" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72" /><p>Draw out the overall shape of the eyeball, <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">and draw a cross to indicate the center of the eye.</span></p></div><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step21.gif" alt="Step 2: Sketch out the shape" title="Step 2: Sketch out the shape" width="150" height="136" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-73" /><p>Next, sketch out the shape of eye and the eyebrows. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Take note that your eyebrow should match the eyes drawn, your instincts can be a good judge for this ;)</span>.</p></div><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step31.gif" alt="Step 3: Draw the details and pupil" title="Step 3: Draw the details and pupil" width="150" height="133" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-74" /><p>Then, sketch where the eyes are looking at. Below are examples how the eyes look like at different directions. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">Take note that the eyes follow the direction he or she is looking at, so be extra careful.</span> Otherwise you'll have a character who is not paying attention :).<br /><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/eyedirection.gif" alt="Looking at various directions" title="Looking at various directions" width="250" height="56" class="alignright size-full wp-image-66" /></p></div><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step41.gif" alt="Step 4: Draw the iris" title="Step 4: Draw the iris" width="150" height="135" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-75" /><p>Now, you eye is almost finished, but the eyes still look lifeless and needs more details. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">So, sketch out the pupils, the dark areas and the light area of the eyes.</span><div class="tutorial-note">*NOTE: You'll need some understanding about "light sources" before determining the dark and light areas. If you're clueless about this, just trace out my examples for the time being, or refer a book on art.</div></p></div><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step51.gif" alt="Step 5: Final Touches - Shading" title="Step 5: Final Touches - Shading" width="150" height="142" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-76" /><p>For the final touch, just shade the dark areas and there you've it!</p></div>{%- endmark %}
