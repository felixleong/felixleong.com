(It was only meant to be a draft, so don't worry if it is not perfect)</p></div>
<div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step2.png" alt="Step 2: Position of the eyes" title="Step 2: Position of the eyes" width="175" height="190" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-32" /><p>Next, draw a cross in the middle of the circle. <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">This is the 'eye position cross', this step is crucial to prevent you from drawing crooked eyes.</span></p><p>Some artist will draw more lines or even circles to determine the size of the eyes. (e.g. thinner lines on the image that indicate the top and bottom of the eyes)</p></div>

Practice does help to achieve this.</span></p></div><div class="tutorial-steps">

Simple eyes will do the trick, and try to make them well balanced and symmetric to each other.</p><p>This might need a lot of practice, but it was well worth the effort in drawing good characters. If you find it hard to draw the eyes, draft the shape first.</p></div><div class="tutorial-steps">

Most beginners will have some trouble in drawing the hair, <span class="tutorial-badPractice">this is because they draw hair strand by strand. Avoid this at all cost! (It's cumbersome, messy, and hard to correct, so why trouble yourself?)</span></p></div><div class="tutorial-steps"><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/step5.png" alt="Step 5: Draw out the hair" title="Step 5: Draw out the hair" width="175" height="233" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-30" /><p><span class="tutorial-goodPractice">In anime drawing, hair is drawn in a bunch, i.e. the overall shape of hair.</span></p><p>No, it don't have to be complex what-so-ever (it's not even rocket science!), you'll be surprised how geometric shapes can create good hair! It proves to be useful in any form of art as you can review the shape beforehand, and easy to add details later (e.g. how the hair will look like if I added some accessories, drawing some strands of hair to make your character attractive, etc.).</p></div><hr style="visibility: hidden; clear: both;" /><h2>Final Result</h2><p><img src="http://upload.felixleong.com/2008/12/finished.jpg" alt="Finished artwork used for this tutorial" title="Finished artwork used for this tutorial" width="175" height="254" class="alignright size-full wp-image-24" />There you have it! You should be able to draw a simple SD Cloud by now :). Add some details (mouth, nose, accessories…) to your character if you like to.</p><p>When you are satisfied with your draft, you can draw it in ink and color it. Believe me, they looked nice in inks and colors, and you might want to make it your desktop wallpaper.</p>{%- endmark %}
