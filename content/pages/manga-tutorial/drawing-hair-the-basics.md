Many had told me that the hair is the toughest part to draw, just because the
final result doesn't look like hair: especially when you're handling tiny
strands of hair to add detail.

Actually, hair is quite easy and fun to draw when you keep these things in
mind:

- **Point 1:** The characteristics of hair.
- **Point 2:** The overall shape of hair, i.e. the hair style.
- **Point 3:** The force applied to hair

With these three things in mind, this will make your life simpler when you draw
hair. I'll explain that in the following section.

#### Pointers:

### Different Types of Hair

This will be <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Point 1: The Characteristics of
Hair</em>.  Learn about them is very important before you learn how to draw
hair, because these details give you a guideline on visualizing the perfect
hair style and where to start.

Basically, there are only six basic hairstyles you should keep in mind
(excluding hair which is tied up, which will be covered in "Basic Introduction
to Forces and Motion"). With these six basic types of hair, you can come up
with different variations of hairstyle.

\* Note: Actually, it can be categorize as 4 different characteristics:
Long/Short, Straight/Curly, Pointed/Draped, Tidy/Untidy. But I feel that this 6
type approach is better in simplifying the task of designing hair.

Now, the six basic hairstyles are:

#### Short hair

![Short hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/short.jpg)

This is the easiest style to design, draw and manage. Short hairstyle is
usually unisex in nature, so designing short hair is quite a breeze.

But one disadvantage of short hair is that there are not many variations to
short hair, making it quite dull. So when you draw short hair, try to add some
hair accessories, have different front hair partitions for different
characters, and add some hair movement to make it more lively.

#### Long hair

![Long hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/long.jpg)

Ahhâ€¦ this is one style that would show the natural beauty of a woman (or even
men!).

But to beginners, long hair is certainly a pain to draw. It's long, so drawing
it is quite a challenge, especially when it comes to hair movement. And to make
it more natural needs a lot of practice to master the art.

When you draw long hair, detail is the key. Adding lines to show the flow of
the hair will help to add the necessary detail to the art. This requires a lot
practice and observation. Once you master this, the variations and beauty will
certainly make your art look professional and your skills will shine.

#### Curly hair

![Curly hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/curly.jpg)

Unlike its straight counterparts, this hairstyle's flow is quite different from
others. And this is another hairstyle that might challenge some artist.

But take a closer look; you'll notice that curly hair usually curls from a
certain point. So this makes drawing this style almost no different from
straight hair, with an exception that you need to know the direction of the
curl, especially the outer part of the hair. With this knowledge, drawing curly
hair is quite simple: you just need to have your drafts right.

#### Pointy hair

![Pointy hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/pointy.jpg)

This kind of hair surely defies gravity, and usually makes the character more
dynamic in looks. It doesn't require much detail, making it much easier to
draw.

This kind of hair looks kind of stiff compared to normal hair, so this make it
ideal for those who are trying to learn how to draw hair. But this kind of
style doesn't suit some drawing styles (especially when your style is much
incline to realistic art), so be extra careful. Oh! Just make sure the flow of
hair is drawn towards the top.

#### "Combed to the back" hair

![Combed to the back hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/combed.jpg)

This kind of hairstyle is also simple to draw, you just need to observe the
forehead hair line and make sure you draw out the strands of hair. But these
kinds of hair just looked dull, so remember to add some extra hair sticking out
from the front (like the one shown in the image), or use it to mix with tied-up
hair.

#### Untidy hair

![Untidy/Unruly hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/untidy.jpg)

This is the hardest one to design, yet it is quite expressive in some ways. I
can't give guidelines on this (since it is untidy, and I can't even draw this
well), but just try not to give it a out of bed look. Don't worry, this style
is uncommon, so you better leave this style for that out of bed look. :)

Now, knowing these characteristics, you should be able to start mix and
matching these hairstyles to create new variations.  Observations (especially
from fashion magazines) and practice will help you a lot in identifying the
characteristics of hair and improving your art skills at the same time. Here
are some examples of different hairstyle variation:

### Step-by-Step Drawing Guide

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Point 2: The overall shape of the hair, i.e.
the hair style</em> might seem similar to Point 1, but there is a slight
difference between them: Point 1 focus on design phase, while Point 2 is much
more inclined to the implementation phase.

Before we draw our characters, we must have a draft beforehand.  And for
drawing hair, the draft will prove to be very useful. And drawing out the
overall shape of the hair will help a lot in drafting, and we will see how
important it is in the step-by-step guide below:

![Step 1: Sketch the head]({filename}/images/2008/12/step1.jpg)

As usual, draw the draft of the face.

![Step 2: Determining hair lines]({filename}/images/2008/12/step2.jpg)

For this step, let me introduce you to another draft line -- the "Hair Line".
This is the line that separate between the forehead and the hair. <em
class="tutorial-badPractice">This is important because most people has a
tendency to forget to leave space for the forehead, making the character looked
odd (which happens often).</em> <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">So, remember
this fact while you draw.</em>

Do you notice the red triangle on the image? Well, that is also another
important marker while drawing, it is called the <em
class="tutorial-goodPractice">"Hair Partition Marker".</em> This is the point
where the hair partitions, it can be on the **left, right, center, or doesn't
exist at all**. This triangle acts as a reference for you when you drawing hair
with partitions.

![Step 3: Rough sketching the hair shape]({filename}/images/2008/12/step3.jpg)

Now, draft the basic shape of the hair. Do take note that <em
class="tutorial-badPractice">the hair doesn't stick to the head (Pitfall No.
2)</em>, as shown in the image. Since hair sprouts out from your scalp and then
bends to a certain direction (usually down), the hair does not "stick"
completely to the head.

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">While you draft the hair, keep a smooth
flow so that the hair looks natural (Always remind yourself to this
fact).</em> Even pointy hair have to maintain a smooth look so that the
character doesn't look like (s)he had a "bad hair day" :).

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">At the same time, I only
draft simple lines for the hair in front (for review purposes). And
I draw out the ribbon to remind me that her hair is tied up
together.</em> Since the ponytail is partially hidden from this
viewpoint, it's OK to omit that.

![Step 4: Drawing out the details]({filename}/images/2008/12/step4.jpg)

At this point, you can draw out the details for the hair.
<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Notice that the fine and
uniformed lines are drawn towards the back where the hair is
tied.</em> This is because there was a force (the ribbon) that
"pulls" the hair to the back. (Refer to the following section)

With the details drawn, the hair is now complete.

### Basic Introduction to Forces and Motion

Everyone knows that hair is not totally solid, and outside
forces is able to make hair move and sway. And because of this,
hair is certainly a pain to draw when it comes to drawing lively,
moving characters. (and that's what makes it interesting!) And that
makes <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Point 3: The force
applied to hair</em> very important.

But don't panic! Once you identify these forces and you know how
to apply it, drawing "moving" hair is very easy. The only thing you
need to know is <em style="color: #00f;">to keep the smooth
flow</em>. To do that, you need to know the forces and its
effects to the flow!

\* Note: If you feel that the topic that
I'm going to cover is too advanced, just take this tutorial as a
common sense lesson, or save this page for future reference.

#### Force #1: Gravity

![Force of gravity]({filename}/images/2008/12/image1.gif)

Simple as that, this is the first flow you need to know. Hair
has some weight, so hair will be "pulled down" by gravity.

![Gravity effect on normal and fixed hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/image2.gif)

But be careful though, there are some exceptions. Especially
when you are dealing with pointy hair, or when your character is in
somewhere where gravity doesn't has much effect (space, underwater
etc.). And another exception is that when the hair is fixed (with
hair cream or natural reasons), and that force that makes the hair
"stick" is much greater than gravity. [See image]

#### Force #2: Natural forces (Wind, water etc.)

![Combination of forces: wind and gravity]({filename}/images/2008/12/image3.gif)

Now, let's add another force into the scene and this makes it
TWO forces. Now, the rule is almost the same (hair moves towards
the force of motion), but with some additional physics in there.
You can see, when two forces was applied, a combined force will
determine the motion (see the red arrow). And the combined forces
will be more inclined to the greater force.

Sounds complicated? Look at the image to have a better
understanding.

#### Force #3: Character motion

![Hair in action]({filename}/images/2008/12/image4.gif)

Now, one thing that why actions scenes are hard to draw is how
to make your art natural. And one factor is to know the connection
between motion and flows of air. <em>[I use stick figures to avoid
distractions caused by details]</em>

As you can see, now we have three forces to consider: Gravity,
natural, and motion forces. And one rule you must keep in mind is
that <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">The flow of air always the
opposite to the flow of motion.</em> Let's see example 1, you can
see that when the character runs forward, the flow of air moves
towards the back.

But don't confuse between the flow of air and wind! These two
can be individual forces. (as in example 3) Do some observation
yourself and you will get the point.

#### Force #4: Point of Force (POF)

![Focal point: Tied hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/image5.gif)

This one is really important if you wanted to draw tied-up hair
(braids, ponytails, etc.), especially when you deal with details
(ie. strands of hair).

Point of Force (POF) is the point where force is applied, and
because of this, hair will gather towards this point.

Let's take the ponytail as an example. You can see that the
hairband (in red) acts as a POF, and hair was "pulled" towards that
point. And those that were not affected by the POF will remain at
its orginal state (see the hair near the neck).

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">So when you draw hair that
is tied up, make sure you identify the POF.</em>
