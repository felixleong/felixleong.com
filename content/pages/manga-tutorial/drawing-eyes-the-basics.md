In this tutorial, I'll put more emphasis on eyes, which I think is the hardest
part to master (the hair comes second ^^).

Why I say that drawing eyes is the hardest to master? This is because eyes
plays an important role in expressing the character. Not only you have to make
sure that the eyes are balanced, you also have to draw out the eyes to show the
emotion of the character. Yeah, hair might be tedious to draw; but mastering
it wasn't that hard compared to eyes.

So, let's get started!

#### Pointers:

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Good tips, tricks and techniques are in BLUE.</em>

### Different types of eyes and eyebrows

![Various shapes of eyes]({static}/images/2008/12/sampleeyes.gif)

Before we start, it is better for us to know some different types about eyes.
Now, as shown in the picture on your right, eyes can take different shape and
sizes. Before you say that drawing eyes are very complex, inspect the picture
carefully.

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Notice that I've drawn an outline around the
eyes, and you'll be surprised that these shapes looks awfully like
polygons!</em> That means that you don't need to be afraid when you are drawing
eyes, it is quite simple to draw (although hard to master :P)

Talk about the shape of the eyes, they can range from circles to hexagons,
anything that have more sides than a hexagon is uncommon in anime drawing. So,
when you start to draw or design eyes for your character, <em
class="tutorial-goodPractice">knowing the shape of the eyes will help you a lot
in drafting the eyes.</em>

The same applies for eyebrows: it also take different shape, color, and sizes.

You can divide eyebrows into two types:

![Smooth vs jagged eyebrow flow]({static}/images/2008/12/basic4.gif)

1. **The "Streamlined" eyebrows:** The most commonly used. It can be a straight
   line, a "hill", or a "small wave" (like this one).

2. **The "Jagged" eyebrows:** Usually these kind of eyebrows are used for
   characters who have an exceptional personality. Many villains have these
   kind of eyebrows, <em class="tutorial-badPractice">but usually not
   females!</em>

### Difference between male and female eyes

Here's also a point to note when drawing eyes for different genders:

![Male eyes sample]({static}/images/2008/12/male.gif)

#### For males:

Eyebrows are thicker, no eye lashes, and usually the eyes are smaller than
females.

![Female eyes sample]({static}/images/2008/12/female.gif)

#### For females:

Thin eyebrows, eye lashes are thicker, and the eyes are bigger compared to
males.

<em class="tutorial-goodPractice">These rules aren't fixed as different
characters have different personalities and you'll have to break some rules for
that.</em> E.g.  An adventurous woman (e.g. Lara Croft) will have thicker
eyebrows.

\* NOTE: The size of the eyes looked almost the same in the samples given here.
But with careful inspection, you'll notice that the eyes of the females takes
up a larger area compared to males.

### Step-by-step guide

![Step 1: Draft the shape for size]({static}/images/2008/12/step11.gif)

Draw out the overall shape of the eyeball <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">and
draw a cross to indicate the center of the eye.</em>

![Step 2: Sketch out the shape]({static}/images/2008/12/step21.gif)

Next, sketch out the shape of eye and the eyebrows. <em
class="tutorial-goodPractice">Take note that your eyebrow should match the eyes
drawn, your instincts can be a good judge for this ;).</em>

![Step 3: Draw the details and pupil]({static}/images/2008/12/step31.gif)

Then, sketch where the eyes are looking at. Below are examples how the eyes
look like at different directions. <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">Take note
that the eyes follow the direction he or she is looking at, so be extra
careful.</em> Otherwise you'll have a character who is not paying attention :).

Now, you eye is almost finished, but the eyes still look lifeless and needs
more details. <em class="tutorial-goodPractice">So, sketch out the pupils, the
dark areas and the light area of the eyes.</em>

\* NOTE: You'll need some understanding about "light sources" before
determining the dark and light areas. If you're clueless about this, just
trace out my examples for the time being, or refer a book on art.
