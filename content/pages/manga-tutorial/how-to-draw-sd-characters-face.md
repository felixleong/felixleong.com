### How should a SD character look like?

![Proportion of a SD character face]({filename}/images/2008/12/proportion.png)

Before we learn how to draw the face of a SD character, here's some simple
guidelines: (Proportions shown in image)


- Face are more rounded
- Eyes are bigger than usual (About 3/8 to 1/2 of the face)
- Consists of simple lines
- The nose and mouth is simplified, and sometimes omitted

Compare this to any ordinary anime character and you'll notice
the difference.

NOTE: The proportion mentioned in the picture was not a standard in drawing SD
characters. If you are not comfortable with it, adjust it.

### A step-by-step guide

![Step 1: Draft out the face]({filename}/images/2008/12/step1.png)

Firstly, we draw a circle as a basic shape of the face. (It was only meant to
be a draft, so don't worry if it is not perfect)

![Step 2: Position of the eyes]({filename}/images/2008/12/step2.png)

Next, draw a cross in the middle of the circle. <span class=
"tutorial-goodPractice">This is the 'eye position cross', this step is crucial
to prevent you from drawing crooked eyes.</span>

Some artist will draw more lines or even circles to determine the size of the
eyes. (e.g. thinner lines on the image that indicate the top and bottom of the
eyes)

![Step 3: Draw out the chin line]({filename}/images/2008/12/step3.png)

Define the chin line, <span class="tutorial-goodPractice">try to draw it with
the least strokes possible, so that it doesn't look messy. Practice does help
to achieve this.</span>

![Step 4: Drawing out the eyes]({filename}/images/2008/12/step4.png)

Now, draw the eyes and eyebrows to the the face (within the eye position
range). Simple eyes will do the trick, and try to make them well balanced and
symmetric to each other.

This might need a lot of practice, but it was well worth the effort in drawing
good characters. If you find it hard to draw the eyes, draft the shape first.

![Wrong technique: Don't draw every strand of hair!]({filename}/images/2008/12/wrongtech.png)

Finally, draw the hair of the character. Most beginners will have some trouble
in drawing the hair, <span class= "tutorial-badPractice">this is because they
draw hair strand by strand. Avoid this at all cost! (It's cumbersome, messy,
and hard to correct, so why trouble yourself?)</span>

![Step 5: Draw out the hair]({filename}/images/2008/12/step5.png)

<span class="tutorial-goodPractice">In anime drawing, hair is drawn in a bunch,
i.e. the overall shape of hair.</span>

No, it don't have to be complex what-so-ever (it's not even rocket science!),
you'll be surprised how geometric shapes can create good hair! It proves to be
useful in any form of art as you can review the shape beforehand, and easy to
add details later (e.g. how the hair will look like if I added some
accessories, drawing some strands of hair to make your character attractive,
etc.).

### Final Result

There you have it! You should be able to draw a simple SD Cloud by now :). Add
some details (mouth, nose, accessories…) to your character if you like to.

When you are satisfied with your draft, you can draw it in ink and color it.
Believe me, they looked nice in inks and colors, and you might want to make it
your desktop wallpaper.
