Been uploading some REALLY old artwork that I have done.

It's pretty fun sharing those artworks that I had in the past: the days when I devote a lot of time drawing stuff and scribbling characters that I adore a lot. Although the artwork is pretty simple and not something that is impressive, the sort of rawness in skill is something that really captivates me: the feeling of youthfulness.

As my own skills improved, I personally find myself drawing less and less. Maybe that I'm losing motivation? I have other priorities? Or is it that I'm pretty frustrated at myself staying in that level of "good" but not "greatness"? Or maybe as time past by, I accumulated so much art and comparing it by amount with the stuff I have drawn lately, the comparison is obvious?

I'm not too about it myself either.

But one thing for sure is that as long I had something that I wanted some form of expression, I would find a way to achieve that goal.

Probably that's what human beings are all about.
