Went to a one-day nature trip with Sook Lan and Yuan Hui today, so it's like… I woke up very early today, a groundbreaking 5:50am. Reached the lobby of our office building at around 6:50am and we departed at 7:30am.

Feeling at that moment: Quite excited and with anticipation.
The agenda: Touring and visiting fruit farms and visiting some of the local food processing factories and businesses, such as potato chips and fish balls, in Tanjung Sepat

First stop, A [dragon fruit/pitaya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_fruit) farm. It's quite interesting because dragon fruits are planted locally only recently, and we got to know more about this cacti-looking plant. And the best part: It has beautiful scenery and some beautiful plants and flowers. Somehow I took tons of photographs like a photographer for documentary journals :p.

Then later on we went to a popular mango farm and all my enthusiasm starts to dwindle. For one thing, the fruit bearing season is still months away from now, which the visits of these farms ended up having us staring at trees with no fruits. OK, probably some flowers, but definitely no nice fruits ready for plucking.

What makes the experience less and less bearable is right after lunch time, when we <i>literally</i> rushed through all our visits, like… 30 minutes for one spot? It's like: WTF?! And it gets really tiring when you are in the air-conditioned bus for about 10-15 minutes, reach destination, walking under the scorching sun and seeing our so-called "nature trip" becoming more of a "shopping trip" (the business people at almost every single spot exploit the good business opportunity in selling their goods at distributor's price). I'm kinda close to getting a heatstroke in exposing such extreme "weather" changes.

Not to mention that we visits lots of places and only stayed for only a short period of time, let's see, the list in time order: Dragon fruit farm, mango farm, beach, a seafood restaurant for lunch, longan farm, mushroom farm, another beach, potato chip factory and lastly the fish ball factory. Try to fit that in within 12 hours and it's not hard to notice that everything is so packed that rest is almost impossible!

I don't know, probably it's only me who prefers to takes things slowly and enjoy everything at my own leisure.

But nonetheless, I get to learn something, some fun moments with friends, took a lot of pretty pictures as well as some really addictive potato chips :p.

Now I'm back home, twiddling while I'm getting Gentoo Linux installed over my old P200MMX machine.
