I was fiddling with my graphics tablets doing some random sketches, then this pretty got through pretty unexpectedly…

OK, I know the proportions aren't right and it really looked sketchy ^^||. But… I don't know, in some way, the expression of the artwork seemed to express what I felt deep down…

But I do look forward to do some real art with a graphics tablet some time. Do felt accomplished when I'm starting to get used this different style of drawing medium.
