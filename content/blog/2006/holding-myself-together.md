My body is now showing signs of being worn out (i.e. becoming weak and prone to sickness), and sometime by the evening I felt really like catching a fever or a flu .\_.

But some rest definitely helped as I felt better, at least for now.

Definitely need to take good care of my body :).

In other news, I got two more CDs from eBay today: SEB 95 as well as Nicki French's Total Eclipse of The Heart :D.
