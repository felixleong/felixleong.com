{% mark post -%}Been watching Jigoku Shoujo/Girl from Hell (地獄少女) anime these few days, as much as I have only watch 6 episodes of it, I can't help not to really ponder about it. Seeing the suffering of people in a fantasy setting which reflects part of real life… the hurts and pains that one inflicted due to another's views on life.

As much seeing from the surface who's good and who's evil is easily separable… but looking more deeper into it, is that really the case…? What is to be defined as "good" and what is to be defined as "evil"? Even seeing the interactions of different fictional characters in each episode with different scenarios, the further I look into it, the harder it is for me to tell. Is the antagonist really to be blamed for causing all the suffering being inflicted?

Come to think about it, in the episodes that I have watched, the story unfolds that causes utter desperation which makes the protagonists to impose the curse despite the fact that they are informed about the contract that they, too, will be going to hell. Should this attempt to pull the last straw be seen as "good"? How about the people which also causes the desperation, the very people surrounding the protagonists? Are they to be blamed for the suffering due to their distrust, ignorance and self importance? Or they shouldn't be completely accountable due to the fact that their limited perception were skewed by manipulation by the antagonist in some way?

… Is it that easy to placing a blame and cause suffering with such convenience? Is it that easy to place immediate judgment on something even though one has limited information and experience? Or is it due to the fact that in reality, the very idea of "good" and "evil" were just plain artificial…?

That's something for me to ponder about for some time.{%- endmark %}
