在这世界里，自己在追寻些什么呢？在这七彩目眩的跑马灯*，难道一切都是那么扑朔迷离吗？
In this world, what am I pursuing? In this colourful yet bedazzling running lights, is everything that confusing?

[*Note: actual meaning of the term is a type of Chinese lantern in which it contains a semi-translucent cylinder with images drawn on the surface. Once a candle is lit within it, the cylinder will revolve, giving the images on it a running, cyclic effect.]
