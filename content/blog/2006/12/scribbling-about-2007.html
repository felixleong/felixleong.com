{% mark post -%}It's a very unproductive day today as I find myself slowing my pace down a little, but probably also due to the fact that it's our department's Christmas celebration today :). And as usual, we had Domino's pizzas and our gift exchange event going on :). Nothing extremely shocking or surprising this year, but seems that we had more laughs this time. Among those crazy gifts were:
- A wall mirror
- A dart board
- A weighing scale
- A doll house… mind you that it's a guy who is receiving it :p

Guess I'm in a holiday mood or some sort. Definitely needed the rest I will be having (if nothing happens, that is :p).

Other than that, I just sorted out my financial plans for next years (more like my expenses plan, though). It wasn't really a drastic change from my current budget that I'm practising now, it's more like shuffling and juggling the numbers around with respect to my anticipation of future events. But I do plan to save more this time round… as much as I do have to admit that I don't know what to do yet as my future plans were as blurry as it gets (what the HECK does this mean anyway?!).

Well… almost time for me to start my yearly review soon! Think probably will start at Christmas time, then I would need to crack my head to plan for some short term goals for 2007 ^-^|||.{%- endmark %}
