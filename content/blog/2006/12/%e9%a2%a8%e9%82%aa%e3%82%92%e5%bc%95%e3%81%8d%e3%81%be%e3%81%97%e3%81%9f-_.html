I just caught a cold X_X, and the more annoying part is that I had always felt that I'm starting to fall sick *just* a few days ago. So it's like… slowly crept up to me as my health goes down the slopes (with me getting more lethargic more easily) and now I ended up sick X_X.

Not sure whether is it the recent stress attack or that my immune systems are building up at a very slow pace after my food poisoning a week or two before. Either way, it's a red light to me to take care of myself.

Other than that… well, somehow with my mood slump this week, I just felt a bit… well, defeated inside. I do have the feeling like… giving up with whatever I'm pursuing persistently. Thinking about it, it really felt like I'm giving up on myself after I perceived myself as unable to understand the things around me anymore -_-||.

But… It's not not wise taking any actions emotionally, especially with the current slump that I'm experiencing. SO~ the plan is just give myself some time to cool my head a bit and probably reassess my situation. :) After all, it might not be such a big problem than I thought, ne?

Speaking of the root of the problem, well? I'm just kicking myself too much over that someone that I have liked for some time but still having trouble to do anything constructive due to various reasons. Maybe I should be more firm and courageous when it comes to my own feelings? Sigh… this guys *points to self* is just hopeless when it comes to these kind of things. ^-^||

Anyway, on a lighter note, I just received some new CDs :D. The Very Best of Puffy! SUPER EUROBEAT presents euro movement! (this is the one J-Euro CD that I need to fill in to complete my collection :D) The Black Mages II The Skies Above!!! Wee~ :)
