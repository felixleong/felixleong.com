If anyone's wondering what happened three days back, put it simply, what happened is this: My ADSL modem, not one, but both modems that I owned, gone "kaput" (i.e. dead). Or at least one of them is a confirmed death and I'm getting a friend to test the other to really make sure.

And it's a very, very unbelievable coincidence that both died at the same time, and I'm back to my "No Internet Days" that I have experienced a few weeks back (around 3 weeks? I suppose).

So the whole cycle was to be repeated again: me taking leave to get one of them repaired, wait for the test results from my friend; if it's dead, send it for warranty and wait for a monthâ€¦ Stuff like that.

Till then, I'm back to a point where reading is my main past time. And I guess it's a good time to pick my Japanese back up again.
