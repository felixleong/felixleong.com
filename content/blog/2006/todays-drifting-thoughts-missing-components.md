It has been some time that I have been developing the idea of having some negative feelings and insecurities stems from certain missing components in life: something that we are know unconsciously but not being able to fully aware of what it exactly is. Think of it, it feels almost like trying to fitting in puzzle pieces… or to try every single key until all locks on the door is open. It is indeed a tiring process at times, but… life isn't something we should give up on, isn't it? :)

Somehow thinking about it, during every chapter in my own LJ (i.e. my own views in life) I seemed to be able to find or understand something important that I first thought was complete, but it's actually more like I'm only completed only one important portion of the puzzle and there's more ahead to solve and progress upon. That pretty much sounds like a never-ending journey as life is just full of infinite possibilities :).

Somehow… just today I realised at a much deeper extent that some of the deeper issues and desires deals with the family. Somehow that's an area I'd discover and explore for some time.

Till then, probably it'd take some time to really find out what my "home" really is.
