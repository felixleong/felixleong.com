Phew! Finally I got two sets of my CNY clothes bought :).

As usual, I bought two contrasting set of clothes, in terms of colours and style (like what I did last year for Fire and Ice Style), and apparently how I got the idea for these two sets of clothes are very random: I have the idea for the first set by an impromptu basis; and for the second set, I have a very clear idea of what kind of contrast I wanted to make, but it ended up as another kind of contrasting idea that I never expect! Sounds confusing, more on that later! :)

Anyway, I'm not going to talk about the first set yet, since that's pretty much last Christmas's news (And I really didn't bothered to take a photograph of it, at least not yet). But just some background information, I got the first set which is a collared shirt with light blue and slightly beige horizontal stripes, which is intended to show the more softer and kind side of myself, and a pair of jeans that I'm planning to match both styles. And so, at that time, I was planning to get another contrasting pair which shows the more rebellious and wild side of myself (think of it like my Ice Style last year): And it **HAS** to be <span style="color:#fa74a3">**PINK**</span>!

And so yesterday, with that idea in mind, I set out to Sungai Wang Plaza to hunt that pink shirt down. But as said, I failed. Somehow it's not that there's no pink shirts that looks funky enough, just that it seems that all pink shirts are mostly of a faded pink (or washed out pink), and usually combined with elements of light grey… which is not the kind of pink I had in mind. I want some <span style="color:#fa74a3">**STRIKING PINK**</span>, DAMMIT! (Woa~ That does make me sound like a whiny emo :p) And those with <span style="color:#fa74a3">**STRIKING PINK**</span> looks so emo that I refuse to try them on XD. LOLOL

Anyway, I went on another go today, with high hopes actually. And just like yesterday, my search is a very challenging one as I strolled Midvalley from end to end, top to bottom (not to mention it's one of the largest shopping mall in Malaysia). That's indeed tiring. However, by coincidence I walked past [Giordano](http://www.giordano.com.my/main.htm): A label that I'm not too fond of because it seems **EVERYONE** are wearing them. BUT~ I just stumble the pink that I wanted **exactly** and the double shirt style really appealed to me. At first thought I was like "Oh no~ Do I really wanted a double shirt style again? Do you remember how hot is it last year?", but the striking colours won me over instantly. Not to mention that it really make good financial sense because I'm buying TWO polo shirts instead of one, so that means that I can get two shirts with different colours in my wardrobe. And I just bought it.

BUT~ That came with a small problem: now with that style, although the contrasting element is there, but it's a completely different statement. Now instead of Mr Nice Guy vs Mr Hotshot, now I get is Mr Nice & Mature Guy vs Mr Young & Hip! And since it's Giordano, I really have to get something extra: a finishing touch that would really give the punch or I would look like everyone else (see statement above. Not to mention I shamelessly stole the shirt and colour matching from the photographs in the store :p)

So first thought came to mind: Either a visor or some sort of accessory that can really compliment the look. But my thought is that nothing really beats a good visor that strikes (impression wise). And here I go again, strolling the whole shopping mall from end to end, top to bottom. And I can't believe that a cool visor is harder to buy than PINK SHIRTS for men! Geez… That's pretty unexpected. It took me hours strolling but to no avail. As I almost gave up, I passed by Metrojaya: A store which I label as "boring", probably it's because of the dim orange lighting and a sea of working shirts when I look into the store from the outside. I was like "Ugh… I don't think that they have anything shocking inside" but I went anyway. And when I go deeper in the store I was **IN SHOCK**: All the trendy and most fashionable clothes and street wear are just **right in the store** and **I didn't notice it**!!!

Moral of story: *Don't judge a store by it's entrance.*

So I got a visor I wanted and here's the result of my shopping spree (I believe some would be in shock this time):

On second thought, it could use some extra touches :p, but I'll leave it as that for the time being :). Let's see what I can find next week before I start posing for some photo shots to mark my makeover attempt in 2006.

In other news, I also bought 12 Girls Band's Dunhuang and Dreams Come True's DREAMANIA. Both are really great CDs :D, enjoyed them right now :).
