Squee~ I just won SEB 159, Maharaja Night Hi-NRG Revolution Vol. 14 & 15 and SUPER EURO GROOVE. On top of my previous winnings, that means 6 CDs for this month! Not to mention that this time round I'm going to have some newer Eurobeat releases this time round (instead of getting stuck at around the 1995 Eurobeat era).

I'm just so excited about this! :D
