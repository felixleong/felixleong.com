What does it mean by "I've changed"?

Somehow after being asked with this question, what seemed obvious isn't so. I can't say that my physical differences a change, I can't say my experiences had made some sort of change in me, I can't say that my mindset, thoughts or behaviour had changed…

As it seems, everything hasn't change in that sense… it's only more or less only improvement, decline, addition or removal, in essence everything's still the same to the core.

Then… what is the "real change"? Probably that's an answer deep rooted and related to the question of a "true identity".
