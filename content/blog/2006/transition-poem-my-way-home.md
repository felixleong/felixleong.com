### Chapter 4 -- The Awakening  

<em>December 2005</em>

Deep asleep…  
All this while  
I was hushed gently  
that it's time to wake up

Never easy  
To open up  
My whole being trembling  
Knowing everything will change completely

It's never  
An easy journey  
Where hope and pain  
Intertwined together as one entity

Finally realised  
How to live…  
That I can't be  
Staying in the dark forever

Slowly approaching  
My eyes opening…  
This is my awakening  
With my eyes watching attentively

Appreciating all experiences that enriches my being…

### Chapter 5: My Way Home  

<em>June 2006</em>

Throughout my journey, I have gained much, I have lost much as well.  
Threading the path, I have loved much, I have hated much as well.

Through the time and tide, sometimes I felt lost, yet sometimes I was found  
Through the faces and places, sometimes I was blind, yet sometimes I can see

The many things around me,  
The many secrets within me,  
In one way or the other  
Unlocked some of the doors,  
Unlocked some of the chains

The many experiences I tasted,  
The many discoveries I found,  
In some way or the other  
Opened my eyes  
Unleashed my senses

Vague as it seems  
The path I saw now  
Was the way "home"  
Whatever that is  
Which I had been ignorant enough to comprehend

Many pains yet to be endured  
Many sadness yet to be encountered  
Many challenges yet to be faced  
Many things yet to be released…

The journey ahead  
Was not as simple as it seems  
And yet  
It's the path that I chose

Let my whole being tremble!  
Let my whole being be shattered!  
Let my doubts be cleared!

Only then,  
I will know  
That I have reached  
To a place of no return…

And that's only the beginning…
