{% mark post -%}My mood now is best described as a cloudy day. Mostly being disappointed by myself and all anxious about the things that happened to me these days. Just one of those days when I felt life is harsh and crazy

But anyway, despite that (or should I say instead of whining over it in my LJ?), let me just share some of my PPP arcade videos taken on Saturday when I was at Genting Highlands (after working hours, of course :p). (Speaking of which, it's been a while I haven't filmed any para videos):

JEAAAAAlooooouSEEEEE~~~~ :p

Here's something you didn't get to see everyday: A PPP machine tilted XDDD.

At least these brighten up my day a littleâ€¦ :) Definitely needs to film some para someday.

[p/s: Yes, these are indeed button shirts! And heavy leather shoes are a bad idea for para, it did took me some time getting used to the weight of them &gt;_&lt;||||]{%- endmark %}
