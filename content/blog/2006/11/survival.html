Somehow I'm sorta thinking about the saying "what doesn't kill you will nurture you"… or something of that kind. With all the sudden pounding and thundering of problems for the past few weeks… or probably months, I'm still wondering how did I managed to survive all these stress and anxieties ^^|||.

I'm not really sure whether I enjoyed the ride though, I do have my fit of rages (luckily curse words were banned from my vocal vocabulary)… well, when I was at the highest point of frustration, that is (translation: when the problems starts to overwhelm me). But at least everything is plodding through, as much it still wasn't as optimistic as I would like it to be ^^|||.

Guess I still have to keep this combative mood at work for quite some time, which is contrary with my own preference of having things at a much relaxed paced. But it's OK, I can manage it, at least that's a learning process that I have to go through.

Right now what's important to me is to learn how to shift gears and be flexible. Well… in a way, meaning know where to draw the line between work and personal life. Somehow I still can't find a way to slip in quality time to learn something new (Japanese, computers and stuff). Hopefully I can figure that out once the tides were lower, I guess ^^.
