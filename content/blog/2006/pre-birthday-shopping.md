Tomorrow's my birthday! And I get to get my own presents today (with my own money, of course ^^||).

By sheer chance I finally found Misia's Marvelous CD <3! But the bad news is that it had scratches that it's can't play beyond Everything ;\_\_\_\_;. Also meaning that I have to go back to the shop and ask for a replacement (less likely, seeing how scarce Japanese CDs were in Malaysia). Probably will see what I'd replace it for then. But seeing the tracklist, I think I'd do a special order for this one :).

I also got some new Japanese books. To be honest my attempts to learn the language are almost on-and-off attempts that didn't last longer than a month ^^||. And I kept buying books to learn my Japaneseâ€¦ I wonder whether is it necessary or just a plain waste ^^|||. But at least I can understand more about it now, not to mention that I'm able to read some xxxHolic volume 2 that I just bought. This is a good sign indeed, but probably I would attribute it to the fact that I'm Chinese (hence guessing Kanji without knowing how to pronounce it) and my basic grammar grounding. This is a good sign, I would say :).

It'll be a normal birthday tomorrow, since I didn't have plans to go out (and I don't reckon that my friends would throw me some sort of surprise event). And if there's no surprises, I'd have end up doing all the pending household chores which I have been neglected for the past two weeks due to many reasons and circumstances ^^||||. But do plan to enjoy a nice cheese cake at Secret Recipe tomorrow (which is pretty much close to my house anyway), which is something I anticipated.

By the meantime, let me just lie down and read :).
