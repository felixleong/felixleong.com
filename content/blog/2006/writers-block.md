I'm starting to have some writer's block on blogging. Not sure whether is that a good thing or not XD.

Currently tying up loose ends in sorting out a programming task, hopefully I can get it right by tomorrow, but the last bit can be a little bit challenging, to be honest. I'm starting to be able to understand more Japanese speech when I'm watching anime, which is a good thing. But I'm still slacking off with my self study ^-^|||.

Been at Universiti Malaya today as our department was organizing a workshop there, and I was really impressed at how big the campus was :D. It's really like a small world to explore on its own. Too bad I'm there for work, otherwise I would have wandered around the place :).

Besides thatâ€¦ well, I'm starting to pick up xxxHolic, and I'm still considering whether I want to pick up the manga of Ouran High School Host Club. Guess I'm finding myself exposed to more shojo-manga ^-^||.
