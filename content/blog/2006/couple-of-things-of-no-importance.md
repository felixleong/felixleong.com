I browsed through [Hakusensha's (白泉社) home page](http://www.hakusensha.co.jp/) and read that Fruits Basket has come to an end. As much as Natsumi had hinted it in many subtle ways, the news was a little sad to me… you know, the same feeling when facing the end or a departure. Somehow these three years of reading the manga, I pretty much have identified myself a lot throughout the manga… as I can related to a lot of things and how each characters felt. The message of courage, initially from Touru and later from various characters, have pretty much resonated in me and has brought me a lot of courage to face the difficulties in life.

But… sooner or later, I will find my own resolve… :)

In other news, I have been watch Ouran High School Host Club (桜蘭高校ホスト部) anime these days. Really can't stop laughing watching it. XD Currently I find myself rooting more on Mori-senpai :p, everything he does has so much feelings without any unnecessary actions. w00t! :D

Anyway, my aunt's away for four days and I sorted out the dinner problem by having two large pizzas from Dominos :p. I have to say that it's pretty much on the pricey side, but at least I don't have to worry about the dishes.
