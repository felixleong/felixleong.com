First shock in the morning: the bathroom is in a mess when I woke up! O\_O
Reason: One of the hook was torn off from the small bathroom cabinet (you know, the one with a mirror in front of the sink?), causing the whole thing crashing down with all the stuff scattered on the bathroom floor. Apparently the ceiling leaks when it rained during the midnight and the wooden back of the cabinet kinda gave way (considering that it's an old cabinet)

Then it's pretty much cleaning up time and I did my chores while I'm at it.

Then later in the afternoon I went to the developer meeting at KLCC. Met up with Sze Hau and Wai Kiat (his friend, see [presentation night]({filename}/blog/2006/little-big-things-or-big-little-things.md) entry), expect to get a very smooth event and being awed by the "mighty" Windows Vista and XBox 360 (Mild sarcasm intended, but by all means I'm still impressed :p). But no, apparently the event coincides with the office renovations as well as electrical repairs and maintenance work. The chemical odours are much bearable compared to last month's meeting, but the current is so unstable that it tripped gazillion times that it made me wonder how they pulled the whole event through.

It's kinda funny to think about it because if you already KNEW what going on in the venue, why not just find another venue suitable and conducive? Spoiling the audience experience is a definitely no-no, you know :).

Then we have a really great time hanging around, chatting, wandering around and window shopping. ^-^

Tomorrow will be as exciting as I go for an outing with Sook Lan and Yuan Huiâ€¦ provided that I can wake up as early as 6 in the morning ^-^||. Need to catch some early sleep later.
