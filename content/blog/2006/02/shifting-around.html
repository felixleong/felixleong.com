Things are shifting around, both physically and mentally.

Physically, we are shifting office, starting from tomorrow. I really have no idea how to pack my stuff as I found that I hoard too much on my desk ^^||||.

Mentallyâ€¦ well, made some adjustments in life: picking up fragments, put them in a container and shake them up to see whether they make a solid mix. (Chemistry and physics, anyone :p)

Trying a different approach in handling things in life, if that's a good way to put it :).
