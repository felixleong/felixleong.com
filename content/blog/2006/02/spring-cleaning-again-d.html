Phew! Just gone through another round of spring cleaning. This time round the changes are really drastic as I <i>kinda</i> go into extremes on chucking stuff out. The criterion: Any perceivable "useful junk" that I have haven't used for at least a year. And literally i kinda shocked myself almost half of the items lying around in my room, bathroom and computer table was cleared away… thinking how much junk I can accumulate after three years of living under the same roof with my aunt. These junk pretty much range from leftover toiletries that I don't like, to printed materials that I'd never bother to read, to bootlegged game soundtrack CDs (read: Ever Anime stuff)… and to some extent, some mementos that I had carried with me but doesn't have any value to me. (I still keep those which really had meaning and value to me ;) ).

Now the things I have yet to do: Cleaning up the bathroom and arranging my stuff. Probably that would take me a few more hours before I can settle down with other leisurely stuff :).
