Here I am now: back in my aunt's house in Petaling Jaya.

Will talk about my Chinese New Year back in my hometown (Kuala Kangsar) later, but just wanted to post something about the most grossest thing that happened in the house: Ants have been building an anthill inside the flushing rim O_O||. It's likeâ€¦ EWW! Seeing ants crawling everywhere on the toilet bowl and when I flushed it to see what happened, at least hundreds or a thousand of live ants (!!) floats on top of the water, with them sticking together making some sort of a raft (or black patches, from my point of view).

Somehow I scooped them out and let them roam free to find a new home. But the experience still gives me the shivers.

Moral of story: Wash the toilet bowl properly before going for a long vacation.
