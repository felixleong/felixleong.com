Starting to move some furniture downstairs. Moving heavy furniture isn't easy, but it's really fun as we cooperate in getting one of the metal DIY shelf disassembled and moved it downstairs :).

Organized my table a bit, probably thinking of shifting down ASAP as I really don't want to have have one to-do item linger in my brain for too long XD.

Other than that… it's pretty much about myself of thinking how much longer I can keep this feeling towards someone to myself… we'll see how things goes on. :)
