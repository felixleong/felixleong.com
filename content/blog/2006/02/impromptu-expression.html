很多时候，觉得很无奈…很多时候，只是能够问候关心几句，却知道自己…究竟是局外人，帮不到些什么。

所以，现在仍然还是努力着…继续地了解你多一些，希望有一天，那份关心…不只是几句话…

A lot of times, I felt as if I haven't had much choice… A lot of times, all I can do is to talk with you, but I know very well that… there're times that I'm an outsider, I can't help much.

So, up until now I'm still working hard… continue to understand you more, and hope that one day, care… is not only just a few words…
