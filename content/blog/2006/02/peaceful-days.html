This week can be simply described as peaceful - simply everything goes on the same after my CNY break.

Of course, that doesn't mean no changes around me really as things goes on as well with other people: some good, some bad, and some unpredicted accidents. But I'm glad everyone's OK, just that this temporary separation and knowing what happened during this gap made me understand better that nothing can be entirely sure and that there's a lot of things beyond our control.

â€¦ Just feeling grateful with more things now :).
