{% mark post -%}为什么不敢去贴近？为什么不敢去确认？

自己害怕些什么？是失去吗？还是得到？

为什么越是喜欢你，反而越是胆怯畏缩？

自己害怕些什么？是幻想吗？还是事实？

Why I'm afraid of getting closer? Why I'm afraid in finding out the truth?

What am I afraid of? Is it of losing? Or is it of getting?

Why is it that the more I liked you, the more I become timid?

What am I afraid of? Is it of fantasy? Or is it of reality?{%- endmark %}
