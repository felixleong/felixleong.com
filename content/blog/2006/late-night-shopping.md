Yes, it's true, that what I did just today.

I was like shopping and on my way to the bus station, and saw it dispatched right in front of my eyes. And I'm likeâ€¦ "Oh great, now I have to walk my way home" (which is only like a 10 minutes walk anyway)

But with my heavy groceries, they ARE heavy. No way of getting my arms elongated. :p And since I got that mop stick on my hands, I sorta came up with the idea of carrying my stuff -- the traditional way.

At least it's much lighter than having them hanging with the support from my grips.
