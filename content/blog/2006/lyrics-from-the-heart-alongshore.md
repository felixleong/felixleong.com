Received this song from a friend:

### 林宇中 - 靠岸  

[曲：李志清 | 词：林秋离/张丽念 | 编：吴庆隆]

你坐在我身边 可是表情很不自然  
聊的话很半凡 却很悲伤  
你说你不相信 活着就足为了梦想  
甚至你更怀疑 什么是地久天长  
咖啡麻醉不了孤单 只会让心更烫  
哦都一样 所谓梦想 终究飘飘荡荡  
在迷乱的台北流浪 寻找一个幻想  
突然很渴望在我身上 找到你要的靠岸  

这一刻 当我们都感觉到彼此的心愿  
爱情早已经开始 思念早己经蔓延  
咖啡麻醉不了孤单 只会让夜更长  
我也一样 飘飘荡荡 眼神交换迷惘  
在冷漠的台北流浪 找一个避风港  
突然很渴望在你身上 也找到我要的 靠岸

Translation (by yours truly ;), it's kinda rough as some Chinese expressions are really hard to translate into English):

### Lim Yee Chung - Alongshore

You sit by my side, but your expression looks very unnatural  
All the conversations are very oridinary/common, but also very sad  
You say you don't believe that to live is completely for the dreams you had  
You even suspect what "everlasting" really is  
Coffee can't make you forget about loneliness, it'll only your heart burn even more  
Ooh~ (It's) the same, the so-called "dream" is something that constantly wavering  
Drifting in the confusing city of Taipei , finding an illusion  
Suddenly (you) strongly hoped to find your shore[^1] in me  

At this moment, when we can feel the wishes of each other  
Love has already started, the feeling of missing each other has already spreaded within  
Coffee can't make you forget about loneliness, it'll only make the night last even longer  
I'm also the same, drifting and wavering, eyes exchanging perplexed expressions  
Wandering in the cold city of Taipei, finding a harbor of shelter  
Suddenly I strongly hoped, and also found the shore that I always wanted… in you

Suddenly I just felt like crying…

[^1]: The word "shore" is a common general Chinese expression of a safe and dependable place. To put it specifically in this context, it means settling down in love
