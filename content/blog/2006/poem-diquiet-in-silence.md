### Disquiet In Silence

又是和以前一样 | Still like the same in the past  
两个人在车子中 | Two people in the same car  
默默在思绪徘徊 | Silently strolling back and forth in thought

笼罩着车的静寂 | The silence surrounding the car  
对比着车外喧哗 | Contrasts the hustle outside it  
是默契还是疏离 | Is it a silent togetherness or a unspoken separation

右边的往前注视 | The one on the right staring the front  
左边的东张西望 | The one on the left looking all around  
看着那不同风景 | Seeing completely different views

手似乎有了习惯 | The hand, as if developed a habit  
在车座试图越界 | Attempting to cross the line on the seat  
打量着两人距离 | Kept on guessing the distance between the two

脸上的若无其事 | That indifference on the face  
总是隐藏不了那 | Always incapable to hide that  
手心的糊涂急迫 | Stupid impatience of the hand

眼眸又不时注视 | The eyes still surveys from time to time  
蠢蠢欲动的冲动 | That blundering longing  
是手心还是心呢 | Is on the hands or the heart

想要接触的挣扎 | That struggle of desire to touch  
就连空气也成为 | Even the air have became  
两人之间的城墙 | The wall between the two

心里那个拉锯战 | That tug-of-war deep within  
在现实与理想中 | Between reality and ideal  
把那份坚定消耗 | Had worn out that firmness of heart

始终依然在那儿 | Until now still staying at the same spot  
不停地猜测试探 | Still guessing and testing the waters  
完全失去了方向 | Completely lost its directions

默默在思绪徘徊 | Silently strolling back and forth in thought  
两个人在车子中 | Two people in the same car  
又是和以前一样 | Still like the same in the past
