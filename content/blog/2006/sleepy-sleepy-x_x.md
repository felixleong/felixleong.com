I'm wondering whether my energy was expended/burned out too fast, a very late night sleep, reading thick manuals or a combination of these factors made me very sleepy throughout the day x\_x.

New challenge: to find ways to keep my energy levels balanced.

Anyway, in other news, this made me forgetting to update my LJ:

These came in on Tuesday (Monday, to be exact, but I'm not in the office then) and I have been spending a lot of time ripping them into my hard drive and listening to them :D.

Maharaja Night Hi-NRG Revolution Vol.14 is a definite classic to keep! :D
