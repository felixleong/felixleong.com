Been on a milk overdose these day, which I had about a litre of milk per day (half of it being the weight gaining type). And I'm expecting to keep that up for likeâ€¦ 2 to 3 months?

Hope that I won't be hating milk by the end of the day. ^-^|| (Seeing that I'm the milk loving type, even plain, full-cream milk)
