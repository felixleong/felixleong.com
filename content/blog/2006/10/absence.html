Currently doing some last minute packing, and I'm feeling sleepy X_X… not to mention that I need to catch the cab at 10:30 in the morning (meaning: 6 hours later): Thanks to myself hanging around too long at Wikipedia reading stuff that brought me down the memory lane (notably: Ultraman).

By most circumstances I won't be updating my LJ for this week, as I will be up at Genting Highlands to work for a whole week. Basically I'm up there to assist the installation of a new system and standby to troubleshoot any problems that arose. Hopefully the whole thing will go smoothly. But somehow I do feel a bit anxious as I'm definitely not prepared… &gt;_&gt;

Well… Just work my best then!
