“别人一定比我更好”，一向以来都存有这样一个观念。或许就是因为这个观念，好多时候觉得自己所做的一切都是徒劳…然后渐渐演变成逃避，畏缩。

生活开始失去了色彩，做事开始失去了自信，开始不敢去冒险改变：这样的我…虽然十分厌烦，但却无意识下接受。接受一个充满垃圾的世界…这真的是自己真的想要的吗？

这，或许是自己曾经不愿意承认的事实吧！

"Others must be better than me", all this while I have been having such a perception. Maybe it's because of this perception, a lot of times I felt that all the effort I put into anything was just pointless… And therefore it started to became avoidance, timidity.

Life starting to lose its colours, I start to lose my own confidence, becoming less and less brave to take risks and change: This particular "self"… Although I despise it, but unconsciously I accepted that myself. Accepting a world full of crap… is this really something that I wanted?

This fact, is probably what I used not to like to admit it at all.
