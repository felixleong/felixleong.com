{% mark post -%}Currently I'm fine tuning my computer a bit, as well as converting my CD collection back to MP3 again X_X. Well… it really can't be helped since a new MP3 player is in the cards (although I think I'm setting back the plan to buy a new one much later… probably middle of next year? But more likely it'd be by the time when my favourite musics start to accumulate to 20GB).

As well, I'm still realigning (at least attempt to) my plans, as in things that I wanted to do. There's seems like mountains of stuff that I wanted to do X_X|||. I think my persistence has been tested for a lot of times in the past with mixed results, but… well, it's just another go to me :).

Still a lot of things that needs some adjustment, so it seemed. Hope I can pull things through :).{%- endmark %}
