Finally~ I got my hands on Domino's self title album and Maharaja Night Hi-NRG Revolution Vol.9! I have been wanting these two albums for years I'm really excited to finally bought them ^-^v.

Just listened to Domino's album and Domino always has the ability to cheer people up with her upbeat tunes :D. This album is really a godsend after a hard day's work! :3

And… well… to be honest, my interest in collecting Eurobeat has always been supported by my insistence in getting MNHR9, it's like "well… let me just get something else until MNHR9 comes along!". With this, I have gained much exposure to different kinds of music. And now… I had achieve that small goal I had, I don't know, it's pretty much a weird thing. All this while this CD has brushed me on eBay on several occasions and I lost the bid in every attempt, and I can't believe I got it easily through Yahoo! Japan auctions (using "Buy It Now"). It's one of the most expensive CDs I bought at the moment (well, having to pay commission to a third party), but I'm very excited about it :).

Somehow it's pretty much a funny feeling, it's like… is it the end? Well, I'm sure that's not the case, the fulfillment of this dream is only the beginning, a continuous journey to explore and collect new music :). The only difference is that now, I just don't have a specific carrot to pursue, and now I can set my sights at a much broader scope :).

I think that's the feeling of accomplishment, neh? :)
