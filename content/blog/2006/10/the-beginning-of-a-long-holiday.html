Let's see… Deepavali/Diwali's tomorrow, Hari Raya/Eid ul-Fitr is on next Tuesday and Wednesday, and seeing that all these days were a national holiday, the company declared Monday as a compulsory leave… Top that up with two more annual leaves of mine on Thursday and Friday, and what I have now is nine days of total relaxation! (Sort of :p)

To be honest, I didn't have plans to take a vacation somewhere or going back to my hometown. Well, it's not that I have any reason not to do those, but I just don't really feel like going anywhere. (as much as I would like a vacation somewhere, but going alone is not what I had in mind at the moment) Probably I would be facing questions on why I didn't go back home to see my parents, well… to be honest, I don't have any strong reasons why I don't want to go back yet I also don't have a strong reason to remain here either.  Just that I decided not to go back and nothing more, I suppose.

At the moment I didn't have any plans yet, but… well, worst case scenario I would have end up staying at home all day surfing the net. ^^|| But we'll see then.
