Somehow, in one way or the other, I did sort of notice that my communication (as in speech and writing) have changed. And at some times, I'm felt a bit isolated, in a way.

Hmm… where should I start this topic…

I don't know how to say this, just that pretty much these days I'm living on my own, in a sense. It's really hard to describe that kind of observation, but it's really like… day-in, day-out, I pretty much carried out my own life by myself. From planning budgets to working to having fun, I'm pretty much capable to enjoy everything… or at least being capable to live on my own with minimal help. And it's not really a new observation as I tend to do things on my own ever since I was young.

Put it with a negative label, I can be classified as a "loner" :p.

Not really that I don't like to mix with people or anything, I'm just not that involved in other people's lives. Well, depends on how you look at it, it is either a good thing or just plain depressing. And the funny thing that I observed in myself is that I'm not that into petty talk; the only time when I felt a real click when communicating with people is the time when I talk about ideas, my own experience and observations in lives: psychology and philosophy stuff. And more than often I find that every time I say something, it's more or less like… both talking to myself and talking to others at the same time (well… probably that's the case or that the real fact is that I gave the impression that I'm talking to myself most of the time).

To be honest I really don't know what to say about it, just struck me weird when I contemplate and observe my own behaviour.
