It's day four since my Internet was down. And I'm to lazy to swap my 56K modem back in so I'm literally out of touch from the Internet.

I forsee that I won't be back up until TMNet settles the glitch, which might be from now to a few days (weeks?) later. But I'm confident that this will get settled soon :).

Till then, updates during office hours! :p (Don't bring that business/employee ethical issues, please? :p)

In other news, I'm still kept to my toes and pressing matters are on in the office. Stress and challenges are piling up at the moment when I'm close to having my job confirmed.

Just hope for the best :).
