Sometimes, being close to another person is like exploring a completely different world.

Without maps, without guidance, we chart the earth unknown to us. And as we start to feel satisfied with some small treasure we found, some unexpected elements in that world will give us the realisation that there's a far bigger world in them.

That'sâ€¦ the greatest adventure in one's life :).
