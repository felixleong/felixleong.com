Phase 2 of this year's makeover starts from today ;). This time round, it'll focus more on the "inner" aspects instead of my own wardrobe :).

Just had a shopping spree at the pharmacy , getting extra supplements and stuff. And probably it would take a few months. Do need some time to explore around and envisioning a healthier self: both physically and emotionally :).

Will keep tabs on my own progress along the way, till then it's definitely a continuous effort on my part. My wallet's going to take some extra damage, so it seemed ^^||.
