So here I am again, at Genting Highlands on standby for the launch of our new game.

Winding back to Thursday, it had been a disaster when we tried to recover the database. Disaster in the sense that the data anomalies were beyond repair and the system is to be launch the next day. So… to cut the long story short, Sze Hau, Kok Weng and I have broke the record of the longest time staying in the office, clocked at 2 in the morning ^^||. And I am expected to wake up at 7.30 in the morning to go up to the hill to standby during the launch.

Looking at the bright side of things, well… at least things were going smooth at the moment and things weren't as hectic as I would have imagined :). That's a good thing. Only thing is that I didn't have any anime to watch here as well as the leisure to browse the Internet as much as I wanted to if I were to be at home now :). But it's OK, at least it's good to take a break off from the computer now (I have been glued to the monitor for the past few weekends) and I do get to eat better stuff up here at the expense of the company :p.

So now the only concern is that I have been accumulating enough leaves due to all the weekend work that I have done. ^^|| It would have been nice if it's convertible to cash (i.e. company reimbursement :P), but I guess it's more about being able to utilize these days for something productive. Or probably I just deserve more rest at the moment ^^.

So now I just hope that things continue to go smoothly, as much as I was more alert (i.e. not really being able to relax completely) at the moment due to my work responsibilities at the moment.
