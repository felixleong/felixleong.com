What is sex, a phenomena so beautiful and yet so obsessive to a point of perversion?

Or is it that we have came to a point which physical touch has been so tainted with delusions that a touch is never a real touch anymore? Or is it that we started to forget the grandeur and beauty of our own bodies that we have to achieve satisfaction from othersâ€¦?

Guess that's the vast complexity of human nature ^-^||.
