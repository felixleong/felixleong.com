There are times when my own short comings bounced back on me in the form of the actions of others.

Sometimes, looking things from a different perspective and a different point of view, how do I see myself in the past and present?

Had I changed now? Or is it something that I needed to change? Somehow, that realization and response is probably something that I needed at the moment.
