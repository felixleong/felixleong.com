Remember Theen Gee, my friend and short-term room mate last year around the month of May (as well)? :) His now back, he'll be sharing my room for a month before moving to his rented room :).

And the good news that he is now graduated and will be working for [The Star](http://www.thestar.com.my/).

And it's going to be a great month to be experienced. And I really enjoyed talking and sharing life experience with him always :). And just talking with him sometimes really made me discovered new insights within myself and in a way, change my life in a subtle manner.

Well~ he came with his younger brother, although he is quite quiet, but he's also very friendly. And seeing the close bond between them, the warmth is pretty contagious. :)

Going to watch Da Vinci's Code tomorrow with them, and it's been a while I haven't been to Borders to catch some nice readings :).
