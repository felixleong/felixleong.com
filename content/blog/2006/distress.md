A lot of stuff that needs to be done, to a point of frustration X\_X||.

Just seems that work just kept on piling and coming my way that I just felt very stressed out.

And thinking that going back to my hometown this Thrusday may not be helping to relieve stress… probably it will cause the opposite, if I didn't manage my stress level/workload well.

Really feel dead at some point, but seeing that I'm surviving, guess I can cope with it. After all, this isn't the first time I ever have myself in this kind of crisis.

In other news, got my modem back yesterday, but it's not working! >\_<|| So I'd need to send it back… I'm kinda worried because I'm not sure whether is it my new modem (which I bought a month ago to take its place) is faulty or my local telephone exchange station. If it's the former, I'm really in a dillema in whether I should get YET another modem or rather live without an Internet connection for some weeks to a month.

Very hard decision indeed.

Hope things goes better in one way or the other. :(
