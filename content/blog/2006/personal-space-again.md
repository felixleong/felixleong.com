It's that day again, seeing Theen Gee moving out. It's been a very interesting month with him, well, probably because he's the only one whom I can really discuss my drifting thoughts (or more like I refrained myself to go all long-winded over these kind of philosophical stuff :p).

So today, with the help from Chin Han (Theen Gee's new colleague), we start to move out the stuff to his new home. And seeing that there aren't much stuff to move, I thought that going to be easy and quick, and how wrong I am X(. Even for likeâ€¦ boxes of stuff which only fills the car boot and the back seat, and throw in a small computer table and a mattress , we only manage to get everything done after 3 hours X(.

So my plans of going out is definitely out of the story as I was dead tired by the time I reached home. (I was planning to go to the office and get some work done, then going window shopping)

And now, I'm having the whole room for myself again. And that's pretty much it :).
