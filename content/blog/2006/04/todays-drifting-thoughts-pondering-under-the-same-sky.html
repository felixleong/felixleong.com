呆呆地望着那一片蓝天，心中期许些什么？看到些什么？

在无限的空间，所谓的“有限”的空间到底是多大呢？自己能够看得见的距离，能够懂得的事物或许也只是那么多而已吧！^-^||

从远方看着自己，到底自己是孤单的？还是幸福的？

…

或许只能傻笑说“我不知道”吧！:p


With absent-mindedness, watching that vast blue sky, what my heart's wishing? What did I saw.

In a boundless universe, how large was the space of that so-called "limit"? The distance that I'm able to see, the things that I'm able to know and understand maybe it's only just that much, I think! ^-^||

Watching myself from afar, Am I lonely? Or am I happy?

…

Maybe I can only just give an innocent smile and say "I don't know!" :p
