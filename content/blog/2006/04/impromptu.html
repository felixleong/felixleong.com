{% mark post -%}好多时候，觉得自己生活就像问号？可能性好多到自己还会觉得迷茫，不解的事想到自己混乱。

一直猜测的好奇心，或许就像人家说的无底洞吧！:p

A lot of times, I feel as if my life is a question mark? The possibilities are so boundless that up until now that I still feel lost, things that I don't understand are being thought to a point of complete confusion.

The curiousity in me which constantly guessing, maybe it's just like a blackhole like what everybody has been describing it! :p{%- endmark %}
