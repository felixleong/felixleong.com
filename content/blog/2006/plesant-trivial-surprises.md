Guess not having the Internet isn't really made me being lazy back home afterall :p, instead I have been ironing things out and settling some matters.

Busy, busy, busy!

It does seem to me that this month is just full of stuff to complete.

It's pretty a pleasant surprise to see Sze Hau and Vivian in the office yesterday :). Somehow I was expecting that I might be the only one in the office. But anyway, probably I might become a temporary workaholic for a few weeks, considering that I definitely need to iron out my testing work ASAP.

I do forsee that it's going to be busy for a few more weeks/months, but I'm sure I'll be OK as everything is workable. I do have to say that the current challenges that I'm facing is still time and financial management. But thinking about it, I think I should rather "label" that as "training my risk appetite". Call that some life courses in learn to live with apprehension and uncertainties (real or imaginary), I guess :).

Anyway, time for me to get things done again!
