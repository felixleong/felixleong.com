If that's the case, I swear that I'd never leave my body cold for a long period of time. That includes sleeping without my clothes on.

In case anyone's wondering, I caught a cold today, which worsens throughout the day. Been sneezing and handling my running nose almost the whole afternoon, which saw my health goes at a very fast, deteriorating pace.

I can't even do without any tissue paper for even one second. Blegh!

The cause of the problem, just out of my whim I decided to sleep with my shirt off. But it was pretty cold through the night as there's a desk fan whirling at full speed, aiming quite close to me, and the night seems to be pretty cold. And it seems that the blanket didn't work as well to warm my body much.

I'm pretty in debt of Peggy getting medicine from the office pharmacy which really improve the situation in the evening.

Really need to get myself back in shape soon!

(And no, I'm not going to believe in any flu/cold pills that will not cause drowsiness)
