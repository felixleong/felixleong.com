I'm back after 4 days over my parents' place. Nothing happened except the fact that I spent almost all my time lying down on the couch or bed.

Although physically it looked as seems as I'm at rest, but honestly speaking it's more of the fact that I just felt heart heavy… I don't know, it just seems that I'm living at two different places, feeling split into two somehow. I just didn't felt being completely at home at all.

Just missing that somebody…

But anyway, my sister is back for a 2 months school holiday and the new house is done minus the furniture and EVERYTHING in our temporary house O_O||. The ceiling turns out to be way too low for us (knowing that our family members are quite tall by our local standards) and it really freaked me out every single time I saw the ceiling fan on the living room: the blades are about 2 metres off the ground, meaning that I can touch the blades without even needing myself to tip toe. Oh dear… the future perils that I'd have to face when I'm in the living room next time.

Probably I don't think I would want them to be switched on when I can help it &gt;_&gt;…

And my sleeping patterns get all mixed up again :p, one of them being that I marathoned the whole episodes of Samurai Deeper KYO. :p It's been quite a while I haven't watched any anime :).

Other than that… just feeling very, very tired ._."… Probably it's been a while I haven't been doing any exercise, I guess :p.
