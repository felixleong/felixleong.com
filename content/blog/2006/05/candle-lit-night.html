Yesterday was a tiring day for me, probably due to the fact that I didn't get enough sleep for almost the whole week. And the accumulating stress didn't help much. Sometimes, working something on a very long period just give me that dangling thought of getting it done, which in turn gave me some unnecessary stress?

Then just soon after I reached home and decided to have my dinner and rest, "POOF!", and complete darkness. Just one of those very, very rare occurrence of a black out. And my mom called me while I'm busy inspecting the mains, but later on I was so tired that I didn't called her back as promised. I just slumped back into my bed.

My thoughts and mood gets very muddled these days as I reflect a lot of things lately. Just feeling a little helpless… in certain things, as much as I'm very disappointed and frustrated over certain events, but being able to understand their situation, I just let my own petty disappointment and frustration "slide". But then again… these emotions still linger in me… that sometimes I really don't know how to handle them.

Just that I still can't get hold of the sense of balance between self importance and sacrifice for the benefit of others.

…

Anyway, felt much better now. Thinking of going out later, I definitely need to get some springs unwounded.
