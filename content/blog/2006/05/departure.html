It was a heavy-hearted day yesterday as it was Sook Lan's last day in the company. It was kinda hard to bear seeing her empty desk right opposite me. For the past year, she has been given me a lot of support and a source of inspiration in dealing with myself and others. In many ways, I have looked up to her as a very close friend and mentor.

It was only a year since I worked here and having myself seeing people coming and going does make it more clear that… everyone is an individuals with different ideals and goals… and through the passing of time, it's inevitable that everyone, in some way or the other, will move on and go separate ways.

Thinking about it… that pretty much includes myself… And reflecting the fact back to myself, it does made me feeling a bit anxious… feeling uncertain with what changes and opportunities are abound. It still the same feeling for drifting afloat without any directions that I had described many times. And learning how to trust the flow, act based on whatever is the best and most appropriate and don't expect any results is definitely not easy.

But coming back, yesterday had been a fun day. We went to Redbox Karaoke during lunch hours and had lots of fun in there. Everyone's enjoying themselves singing and making jokes among each other.

Inevitably in the end, we would have to say goodbye, and all I can hope is the best for her journey ahead.

Miss you lots!
