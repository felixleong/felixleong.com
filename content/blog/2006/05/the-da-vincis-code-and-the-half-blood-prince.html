{% mark post -%}Just watched The Da Vinci's Code :), and apparently it was a pretty good movie. Well, probably due to the fact that I didn't read the book yet and I have less reasons to have myself disappointed about (like the Harry Potter movies :p). But treating most parts as fiction and not involving any sentimentality/emotions/opinions to it (well, probably due to the fact that I'm not a Christian myself?), it's really interesting to ponder about religion, politics and how belief will affect one's judgement towards certain matters. That alone is a very vast area to actually put into words and it definitely worth some thought later on.

And in other news, I just got myself Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince :Dâ€¦ of course that pretty much implied that I got it at a good discount (the hardcover copy sells for only RM39.90 at Borders, which is about half the usual retail price). And that really made me happy! The only thing that I am not is that I can't marathon it starting from today and I'd have to read it in parts :( (considering that I DO have a day job). But that's pretty OK, at least I can read it on my way to work :).{%- endmark %}
