Feeling a taste of bitterness… Being jealous.

As much as I understand everyone needs their own space and privacy… but sometimes… *sigh* I really don't know how to say. Just felt all bitter inside me without any strong basis to be disappointed about.

That really made me think… whether is it that I don't know what others are thinking, or that I don't know what I'm thinking myself. :(
