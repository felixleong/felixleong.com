Oh crap! I accidentally scratched my (miss)understood CD T\_\_T. The reflective part, as in. As much it seemed that only the surface paint got scratched and it still plays perfectly, but still… *heart breaks*

Well… the only consolation is that the CD will be quite easily available for a long time to come, but then again, it's still quite expensive.

Anyway…

Currently spending time converting all my CD collection to AAC format, as my iPod is currently running out of space. Considering the fact that it almost saves me 10MB per CD and that I have about 130+ in my collection, that's about 1 extra GB of space for more music.

But GAH! It's a lot of work.

… And it better don't scratch another of my prized CDs T-T.
