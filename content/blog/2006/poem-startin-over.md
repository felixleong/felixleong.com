自己想要的东西真的好遥远…  
看到如此情景难免痛哭起来…

让温暖的眼泪释放出去  
原来堆积在心中的眼泪  
是那么的多啊！

自己真的是累了吗？  
不如歇一歇再做打算

眼前的路似乎好不平坦  
看起来自己不好好努力  
就会彻底地失去哦！

就再来多一个  
Startin' over  
从新认识过一切一切

自己想要的东西真的好遥远…  
但至少看得到…  
它真正在眼前存在着

The things that I really wanted is really so far away…  
Seeing this scenery, it's really hard not to cry….

Let the tears of warmth be released  
Only to realize, the tears being pent up inside  
Is really a lot!

Is it that I'm really tired?  
Why not just give myself a rest then decide

The road ahead seemed so uneven  
Looks like if I don't strive even harder  
I'll lose everything!

Just go on one more time  
Startin' over  
Trying to understand everything from the very beginning

The things that I really wanted is really so far away…  
But at least I'm able to see…  
That it really exists in front of me
