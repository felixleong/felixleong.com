虽然真正需要的是“长久”的幸福，但是会渴望想象的却是那霎那的心跳。

为什么会这样想呢？或许有些东西就是那么难捉摸吧，只懂得一些容易感觉到的东西吧！

Although what I really want is a "long lasting" happiness, but all this while I'm only able to desire and fantasize that momentary heartbeat.

Why I thought that way? Probably it's because that there's some things that is that hard to understand and get hold of, only knowing the things that are more easier to understand and feel.
