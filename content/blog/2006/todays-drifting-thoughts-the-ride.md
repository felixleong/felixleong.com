Took leave today, and my emotions are like… meh .\_.

It's been kind of a depressing state when I spent time reflecting on recent events… Not because that something happened, but rather the lack of it. It's really like, I sensed something is different, yet I just can't pinpoint what nor I'm able to see where that's coming from.

And there's some questions that I really wanted to ask… yet I really don't know how to ask without feeling awkward. >\_<|| And there's more questions… about self-centered-ness and interpersonal communication and relationships. And I'm like… the more closer or intimate with someone, the harder I find myself to understand them, expressing my concerns or that not to become a burden to them.

Is it really that I can't do anything beyond? Or is it that I had the sense of fear of committing myself into participating in their life? Or is it the whole inferiority complex all over again…?

…

In other news, computer related pet peeves! Anyway, in short, thunderstorms killed two ports on my switch/hub and my on-board LAN port. Luckily that the other ports are still functional and that I still have a spare LAN card. You can read up the details in my technical blog if you wanted to know more about my life in general today:
