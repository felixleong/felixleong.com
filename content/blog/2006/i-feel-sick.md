For those who are wondering why my disappearance a few days back… due to my carelessness of drinking the cup of water which I have left on my office desk before I went up to Genting Highlands (read: three days), I ended up having food poisoning and fell sick until yesterday.

Moral of the story: Don't leave food or drinks on your office table after you left… no matter what and at whatever cost!

Now I'm still recovering… My health and appetite has yet to recover back to normal, and I do feel a bit dizzy at times when I walk around (especially right after I get out from bed). I wonder whether it has to do with blood circulation? At the moment I really felt that I didn't had enough blood in my body :LOL:.

Apart from the fact that I'm not in my top position in doing anything (I can't think properly, I can't eat properly, I feel tired easily), at least I'm able to resume my daily life. At least I got the week off from work, so that's a good chance for me to rest.

Anyway, thanks to all my colleagues (not to mention I was rushed to hospital at one point) and sorry for making everyone worried :(.
