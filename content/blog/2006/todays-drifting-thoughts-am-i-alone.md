I don't know whether I should say it has been a slow day or not, but certainly it was a quiet one indeed. Been spending most of my time either in front of books or my own computer.

Somehow, spending most of my time alone did gave a lot of room for myself to observe my own emotions and feelings. But honestly speaking it wasn't something new that I'm trying to figure it out, it's still about loneliness and the need for physical closeness (yes, the issue on sex was included). It's sorta funny that I can't figure it out, considering how long I had been trying.

But somehow I think the sexuality issue has been resolved in one way or the other. As much as I'm still flexible and open minded about it, but yet I still need to take a stand as a starting point of my own discovery process. At least that's how I think about it.

But as part of the parcel of my own decision… I guess it'd hard for me to say what's in store in the future. As much as I know exactly who (as well as the type I would like to be with in a generic sense, depending on future outcome) I would really want in my own life… I can't deny the possibility that I'd be living alone. But either way, I can manage it… whatever alternatives and combinations it may be.

I think that's where I'd start from now.
