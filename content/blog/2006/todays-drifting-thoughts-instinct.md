One of the funniest realisation today is that the actual reason I kept a distance with the person that I'm closely (and secretly) intimate with is not much of a virtue of respecting others, but most due to the fact that it's my physical/sexual arousal that I fear that I'll "eat" them up :p.

Silly hormones :).

And I can't believe that I've been through all this unnecessary struggle for the past 6 years… even until now ^-^||.

As much as I have experienced and believed that platonic relationships exists… well, I don't mind getting the whole package :p.

… I hope this is not wishful thinking ;p.
