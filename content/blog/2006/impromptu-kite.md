若说心情就像风筝一样，周遭的环境，人与事务就像四周的风一样：在不安定，不测与混乱中飘扬。

或许有时自己有时会忘记那个拉着线控制局面的人。只是记得自己就是风筝…

但回首想想，原来一向来自己也是糊涂了：真正的自己，正是在拉着线的那个人。

If feelings are to be described as a kite, our surroundings, people and events are just like the winds around it: Flying in all the uncertainties, unpredictable and chaos.

Maybe, sometimes I forget the person who is pulling the strings and controlling the situation. Only remembered that I'm the kite…

But thinking about it, only to realize that I am confused all this while: The real self, is exactly the one who is holding the strings.
