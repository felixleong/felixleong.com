Well… just thinking of a need to dump my own sketches somewhere, and so I had an account :).
http://felixleong.deviantart.com/

The recent artworks I had done and posted on LJ was featured there in the "Scraps" section and I have added some comments to it. But, to be VERY honest, I wrote those comments for the sake of writing them XD. (well… not really, as I have put some thoughts into it and explains about my own experiences when I drew these arts. And these comments weren't something that I would like to remember, hence it's not in this LJ)

BTW, they are in full size (640x480) instead of 320x240 that PhotoBucket had made them to be (due to file size restrictions).
