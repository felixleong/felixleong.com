或许，是不了解爱吧！

所以，才不敢去爱那些真正懂得爱的人。因为他们是不可能被占有，反而自己会被他们的存在所占据。

至少自己那么认为。

Maybe, it's because of not understanding anything about love!

Therefore, people didn't dare to love those who really understands love. Because they are impossible to possess them, and on the contrary one will be conquered by their mere presence.

At least that's what I think.
