{% mark post -%}Keeping things short:

- Mood fluctuations, but mainly work stress

- Got myself a new pair of glasses, which I won't be posting photos now because I'm currently un-photogenic :LOL:. Anyway, my eyesight is facing a slight decline… but still it wasn't a good sign. :( But I just got one of those thinner lenses which is claimed to have smaller degrees of distortion. And now, apart from an unusually clear vision (close to 20-20?), I'm still in the progress of getting used to views with lesser distortion XD (imagine when you switch from a normal, curved screen TV to a flat panel, the difference is more or less the same, albeit it's not that obvious to the eyes)

- By accident, I went to one of those free outdoor concerts organized by My FM (a popular Chinese radio station in Malaysia). Get to hear Yu Zhong's (林宇中) 靠岸 (Shore), and it's definitely an experience and I felt very deeply to the song. Guess it's one of those experiences when you listen to a song that you really like live.

- Still juggling work, I'm not going to elaborate about it

- Still sorta feeling frustrated, probably because I'm in one of those emotional tango. *Sigh* Sometimes I really have no idea what's on his mind… or probably I'm just impatient to jump onto the trigger. I don't know, probably we do need to know each other more before either one of us can make a decision, I guess?

- Been spending a lot of time posting stuff to Deviant Art. Planning to get all my better artworks up there.

Anyway, that's about it.{%- endmark %}
