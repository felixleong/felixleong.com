好多时候，反复地问同样的问题，却没有得到一个真正的答复。

有时问久了，或许自己也气馁了，就没追究下去了，没在去问了。

之所以好多与你有关的东西，都算是自己猜测，甚至有时是凭空想象出来的东西。

无法肯定这是真正的事实，真正的你：这种对人怀有虚伪假想这样的感觉，很讨厌。

这个时候，才深深体会到，原来自己也是有错：每一句对我说的话，即使多琐碎也好，即使多虚伪也好，即使多讨厌也好，原来也是有“价值”的 －－ 就是那么希望去了解别人。

A lot of times, repetitively asking the same questions, but not getting a real answer.

Sometimes, it has been asked so many times, probably I gave up of asking myself, so I didn't further pursue the matter, didn't ask anymore.

That's why a lot my perceptions towards you, can be considered as my own guessing, and sometimes it's even my own imagination.

Unable to be sure this is the actual fact, the real you: this feeling of having artificial perceptions towards others, is really something that I hated a lot.

At this time, I can deeply feel, I myself is in the wrong as well: Every single word being uttered , no matter how trivial, no matter how artificial, no matter how dislikeful it is, really has its own "value" -- that to express one's greatest desire to understand others.
