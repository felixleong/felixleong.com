GAH! Just got a bombshell from the boss today O_O||: I'd need to suspend my current testing and was expected to complete my programming task during this week O_O||. Not to mention that it was scheduled for 9 days and I only have about 3 days to complete it! X_X

To be fair, I'm already way behind schedule in work due to several factors, my mistake actually to underestimate certain things. And considering that my work is blocking the payment schedule (as in collecting payments for the work we had done), there's no room for me to argue anything.

Sighâ€¦ I wonder whether I'm able to pull this off nicely. _O_

Anyway, in other news, I really wondered whether guys will take "cute" as a compliment? He has definitely made my day today for that :).
