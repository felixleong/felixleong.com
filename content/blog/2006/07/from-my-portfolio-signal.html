Just one of my better scribbles that I done just now:
<a href="http://photobucket.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/artwork/signal.png" border="0" alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting"></a>

Wellâ€¦ I'm not sure <i>why</i> I would draw this, I sorta let myself flow with my own sense, I suppose? Guess I can call that "art"? :p
