{% mark post -%}I'm not going to repeat myself how busy I was (and how much behind I am in terms of work schedule X_X).

Anyway, somehow I'm still keeping my books on my head. Boring accounting work, they say :p. Apparently, with my long wish list on my head, sometimes I get a bit impatient with my own progress, I guess ^^||.

Speaking of which, it's been a year and two months since I started work, being through a lot of different experiences throughout this period. I don't think I have written this down in my LJ during that time, but I still remembered the time when I received the job offer, I said to myself that I'm giving myself two years and decide where I would go later. And now… well… I'm still pretty much undecided ^^||.

Well, to be honest, during that time, actually I felt that I'm pretty much at a crossroad: two paths that I wanted to take but I'm only able to pick one, One of them being to pursuing my Masters programme overseas, or that I remained here to work. And so the choice has been made. And I told myself that I will give myself two years to expose myself to different experiences and think about where to go later.

And coming back to the present, well… with my present situation, I'm pretty much in a very comfortable state, at least I'm doing pretty well financially (although I don't think I'm going to reach my 25K mark this year, as I have aimed for as <a href="http://felixleong.livejournal.com/239262.html">my new year resolution</a>), my work has always been good to me, and the people around have been very supportive and helpful throughout my journey here. So, in a way, I have pretty much ample room to think about where to go actually.

But currently there's still a lot of uncertainties and possibilities… too much variables in the equation that I can't really fit anything on my road plan yet: factors including my present situation, issues and desires as well as the environment's opportunities and limitations.

Currently the biggest puzzle blocks includes plans to go overseas (either studying, work or travel) as well as plans to buy a house or some sort (more like a small place at a location that I really fancy :) ).

Hmm… I really wondered where will I be then?{%- endmark %}
