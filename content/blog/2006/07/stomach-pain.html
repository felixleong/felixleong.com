I really wondered what I ate. Really. My stomach is feeling funny, and I have seen more liquid than anything for the past three days :(.

Not really something that needs medical attention, but hope this does not continue… (by then seeing the doctor is inevitable)

In other news, it's been a slow day today, which gives me some ample time to work on some progress. But I not really feeling healthy today so I pretty much kept silent throughout the day.

I'm still having drifting thoughts and have my own feelings analysed in my head… you know, still about the distance between two people. I don't know, it's like within a short period of time, sometimes I felt there's a barrier between us, yet sometimes I felt that it's not there at all. Just sorta want to figure it out or something… but I guess it would take some time for a realization somewhere that I can really put it into words. The understanding is not there, I guess.
