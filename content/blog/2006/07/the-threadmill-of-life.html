Somehow there's a lot of thoughts in my head, seeing those never ending cycles in life… that what we are actually living is just merely running on a threadmill and going nowhere: Just running after the carrot in front of us.

At time like this, I always welcome some rethinking in life ;).

Anyway, my work progress is still sluggish X_X. I definitely need to get some work off from my shoulder at the moment, and that's a challenge by itself ;). I will definitely need some space for my own personal skill development. One step at a time, that's still the motto in my own life.

Just finished Gankutsuou (巌窟王), an anime re-imagination of The Count of Monte Cristo, thanks to the recommendation of my brother. Breath-taking watch indeed. :D The script-writer have sort of rearranged the subtle relationships between the characters, their fates and the timing of events, but the plot points and details were very similar to the books. I can relate very much to Franz d'Epinay in the anime… :( It's definitely worth watching and probably worth reflecting ourselves at the same time.

Anyway, I think that's about it :).
