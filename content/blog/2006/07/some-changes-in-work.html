Some work related updates: Someone new came into the office today, which, in a way, have the looks like Daniel (Malaysian Idol 2 winner). And he better don't know that I'm the one marking his paper during the competition (wellâ€¦ which will be known sooner or later anyway).

Then four of us, including myself, got a new PC to work with :D. That's definitely good news because with 128MB of RAM (on the old PC, that is), it's REALLY hard for me to open tons of applications at once. And large LCD panels are always tempting ;).

But the bad news is that I'm lagging very behind at work :(. The thought of it is only bound to bring nervousness and irritation. Red signals and challenges ahead!!! O_O||

In other news, I just got myself Utada's ULTRA BLUE (I believe I could hear some fanbois/fangirls screaming XD), haven't got round to listen to it. And, for a change, I got Dream Theater's Octavarium. Basically this is pretty unexpected, the first time I was exposed to their music is definitely when I heard one of the shops playing Overture 1928 and I'm like "WOW! THAT'S the kind of rock that I wanted to listen to". And so I got one of their albums.

Planning to get my hands on Kitaro's Kojiki as well, which I have been wanting it so badly for years. But that'd be next month, I guess ;).
