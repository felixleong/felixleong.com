{% mark post -%}I'm still playing catching up at the moment. Everything seemed normal but in actual fact I'm still struggling to get work done X_X.

And yeah for me screwing up stuff X_X||.

In other news, why do I always need some sort of signal before I'd EVER make my first moveâ€¦ X_X I'm not really sure whether is it just me being overly-perfectionist style of making sure that I get things right or I'm just finding excuses to cover the fact that I had chickened out.

People can be just unpredictable at times.{%- endmark %}
