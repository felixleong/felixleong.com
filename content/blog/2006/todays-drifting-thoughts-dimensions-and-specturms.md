> "But that feeling of being belittled, patronized, or seeing it amongst others, it was rooted through the sins of anger & pride, sins which did nothing but veil a pure action. Behind it all was the essence of love, through family, friendship, lovers - where one was working in another's garden to help them grow. Helping them understand was limited when mindsets were so different. But that's a journey on of its own where they continue to walk side by side. One curious to what would come next, the other very well aware of that person's future, the good and bad, the beauty of nurturing."
-- Quoted from Ahmed

This morning I thought about the dimensions of one's speech and conversation, and I seem to notice that when one speaks, what we hear is not just "your point of view" and "my point of view (i.e. interpretation)", there's also a hidden part which is "your desires (sometimes, and most likely, will be "what I actually wanted or wanted to say")" or "my desires (or sometimes, crudely put, "what I wanted to hear (and what I don't)")".

Kinda remind me of the [Johari Window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window) concept, in a way. Just an very complementary association.
