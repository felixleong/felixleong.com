It seems that every single time I had holiday and that I had no activities or programmes scheduled, I'd end up doing some major house keeping. ^-^||

Same goes for today, and it's can be quite tasking.

As much as one of my own small little dreams is to own a house of my own, somehow thinking about the house upkeep and the work behind it does seem kindaâ€¦ umm, intimidating :p.

Maybe I'm better off planning for an apartment instead? Does made me wonder though :).
