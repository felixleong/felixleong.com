［缘起篇］  
就在高楼丛林中  
看到一片  
漂浮的落叶  

［迷失篇］  
没地心吸力的空间，迷迷糊糊的被风儿飘荡  
没方向感的宿命，到底静止的终站在何方？  

［自由篇］  
就让我在天空吧！那么的一刹那也好！  

[Chapter: Beginning]  
Among the forest of towers  
I saw  
The floating leaf  

[Chapter: Lost]  
In a space without gravity, being drifted away by the wind dreamily  
A destiny without any sense of directions, where's the silent stop…?  

[Chapter: Freedom]  
Let me be at the sky! Even if it's just for one short while!
