The whole morning I have been sneezing so uncontrollably that I just thought to myself that this is just not right. It's like, I'm perfectly OK yesterday, and I'm perfectly sure that I didn't make anything that would cause me a cold.

Then don't know by what chance I notice the strong wind and the [rambutan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambutan)[^1] tree outside, and it's just not surprising that it's blooming flowers.

And that just confirmed that I am allergic to pollen. That means that I will not have any fresh air in my room for some time (my room is JUST opposite the rambutan tree). Damn.
