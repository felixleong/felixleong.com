Thinking of life as a series of peaks, plains and valleys…
Think back of the times when I was at different points at different times…
All my emotions and thoughts…

Was there really a place that I'd call a paradise? Seems like as much happiness that I had, there was never a place that would made me feel like in paradise continuously…

Was there really a place that I really despise? Seems like at every single point of time, all terrains seemed to have something that I desired of that I can't possibly be despising it.

Is this what we call as "discontentment"? That with it, wherever I go, there'd always a hell hiding somewhere? But it seems that discontentment is not something that we can dispelled by fight or flight. Then what is the path of "contentment"…?
