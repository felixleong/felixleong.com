Been up here in Genting Highlands alone to do some work, and it does seemed that I'm starting to get used to it now. You know, dealing with uncertainties, stress and stuff.

It's kind of an achievement of my own as I find myself being less timid when it comes with communicating with others, but that doesn't make my communication skills less clunky as I have been having some hiccups here and there. I mean… a lot of them. Not to mention that there's bound to be misunderstanding sometimes… so… yay for new challenges? :p

Other than that… let's just say that I'm missing somebody :).

Till then, I might as well enjoy the journey and learning experience :).
