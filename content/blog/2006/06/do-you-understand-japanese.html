{% mark post -%}Things are going pretty well these days. Well… Probably because I'm not feeling frustrated when nothing comes along (i.e. no progress). It's quite a good feeling: being in the valley and rest for a while. The waves of excitement will have its time when it comes.

At least that's what I think now :p.

For some reasons, I just felt the urge to write more Japanese while I'm still learning it. It's sorta weird expressing myself in a completely foreign language, not to mention that I have to piece my thoughts together using whatever word I found in the dictionary, without knowing any small little details and nuisances in itself. I'm still feeling a bit nervous since I can't find a mentor or some sort to guide me through this journey.

Currently I'm still focusing on the reading and writing aspect of the language, considering that I don't have anyone to speak Japanese with. But at least that should do well at the moment, considering that I'm not planning to sit for the proficiency tests.

Hope that my progress would be good :).

(Speaking of which, I had a sudden interest in picking up Korean someday :) ){%- endmark %}
