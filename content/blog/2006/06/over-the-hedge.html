Just watched Over The Hedge today and I'm now still regretting the fact that I didn't ask anyone out to share the same fun and laughter that I had with this animated feature :D.

And what else for today is that I went to the International Chinese Book Fair in KLCC today and WOA! It's definitely a bookworms' paradiseâ€¦ well, at least those who can read Chinese, that is :p. My legs are still aching after that, considering the fact that the occupied halls are just massive! Not to mention that I go through and forth from end to end.

But it had been a great day today, and the funny thing was the fact that I spent more money on music CD than books, and the only three books I bought are comics :p.

And that pretty much was a feast for my eyes, ears and brain :).
