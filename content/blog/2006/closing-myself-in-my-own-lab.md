I have been spending most of my weekends staying at home getting my Gentoo Linux running. What I didn't expect is that compiling software is a painfully long process T\_\_\_\_\_T.

Up until now, I only set up part of my system, which can barely fullfil my computing needs. There's still tons of packages that I need to compile before it's becomes complete.

But anyway, it gave me a lot of time to gain some real Linux experience (that's a very sugar-coated way to say that I'm having a nightmare when I faced some major stumbling blocks :p). That gave me enough reason only to recommend Gentoo only to intermediate Linux users and everyone else should be much more appreciative with the easier install route provided by most distros.

Technical stuff aside, well… it's been pretty normal these two days, it's been peaceful physically and mentally. It's been a while I haven't rested fully, I suppose :). It's been a while that I have been into deep thoughts, thinking how have I been redefining myself through my own journey. As I started to put my different periods of the past and present into prespective, I feel the need to bridge my own internal and personal differences… or you can say that I'm working on a peaceful climate for myself, well… if that's a good way to put it.

Hmm… inner strength and peace….
