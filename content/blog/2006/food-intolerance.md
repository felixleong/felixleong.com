Let's see… these day my stomach get upset very easily. Not sure whether it is because of my protein rich diet I have been keeping these day, or probably because I'm not having enough vegetables. And it really felt like… I have been feeling more and more uncomfortable with my digestive system isn't working well these days.

So I'm like… not really sure what should I do, as I'm still on my weight gaining plans. It seemed that I can't handle a protein rich diet, so I need to figure out some way to gain way in a gradual manner which will not upset my stomach.

And speaking of which, I went to Saisaki, a restaurant specializing in Japanese buffet, with my office friends (Sze Hau, Kok Weng, Yuan Hui, Hui Ying, Vivian and Chee Leng). And we did had a great time except the fact that when we are almost done, my stomach isn't feeling all that well. I'm not sure whether my stomach is not tolerating with the oyster or the sashimi. Most likely the oyster because I remembered I felt nauseous of having raw oyster some time ago.

Probably I would need to slowly adapt to it.

Then today, my stomach felt like a washing machine, but that's because I'm feeling sea sick in the taxi (I went to Genting Highlands today).

Now I'm really need some guidance in tweaking my diet… meh.
