It's been a quiet birthday today, probably been a while I didn't spend quiet time alone: reading books, enjoying good food, watching anime… Just simple pleasures with myself, so it is.

24 years I have been here, I wonder how much that I have been through? Somehow that's something that I didn't understand completely… or at least I can't pinpoint the scope of my own question :). In some way or the other, the birthday wish for this year is still almost the same as last year in terms of pattern. It's just a small wish, really, but sometimes the simplest things may be the hardest thing to get in life, isn't it?

There's more for me to learn, really. At this point (I believe I have repeated several myself in this LJ at different times) it's much more harder for me to say what will happen next. Is it a lack of future planning or focus in life? I personally think that's something that you can think in both ways, I guess. After one has experienced and accepted the unpredictable and uncontrollable facet of life, it's hard not to really contemplate within myself, I guess. Somehow I just feel that what I can do now is to do my best and set a few mental goalposts along the way.

Well… at least now was the first steps towards 25. I wonder what I should think about that number, it's halfway to my 30's ^^|||.
