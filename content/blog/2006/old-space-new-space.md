## Before:

Here's my desk in the old office:

!['Old Desk #2'](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/Misc/mydesk2.jpg){: .img-responsive}

## After:

Here's my own partition in the new office:

!['New Desk #2'](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/060303/IMG_0791.jpg){: .img-responsive}

!['New Desk #3'](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/060303/IMG_0792.jpg){: .img-responsive}

It's *pretty* organized at the moment, but I don't think that will last for long :p. But I have more space to hoard stuff, I suppose :p.

And yay for having the network fixed :).
