I had the feeling that I should have visited the doctor yesterday X\_X. Been feeling pretty unhealthy today, with symptoms of a cold. So it's like… having a sore throat (felt more like I had an infection or something), my body having minor sores all over and not feeling all that energetic.

And finding out the doctors around my area are all closed in the afternoon is not helping things out.

I still have to clean my room and do all my laundry, at least my health still allows me to do so. At least after cleaning the room I felt much healthier, I guess I have to sweep it quite often, knowing that my allergies are getting much worse than I thought.

Guess I'm having a "engine breakdown" of the body? Hmm…
