Two day I have been sleeping without a blanket, and to be honest it's very hard to sleep without one. It's not that I'm feeling cold or anything, just that tingling sensation of having legs exposed without any cover just made me feel… insecure?

It's almost like the feeling of sleeping without a teddy bear or soft toy, you know, some people have that kind of attachment to something that they just didn't feel secure without it… and sometimes knowing the fact that it's much more of a superficial need than a real one.

Probably the existence of covers and teddy bears fills in the need for warmth, touch, protection, company and probably love? It's sort of possible, thinking about it (probably doing a Google search on phychological topics might give me tons of results?)

Till then, probably it's a good idea for me to get a quilt cover as soon as possible.
