A Philips SPA2300! That's what I got for a new 2.1 speakers :D.

And I'm still getting used to clarity of sound and hardpumping bass, the sound shines instantly with Kitaro's Kojiki, but the rest sounds a bit unusual to me.

But knowing my dance and rock music ratio, it has the potential to annoy :p.

Andâ€¦ I also got the 1GB thumb drive. At that time, I was really like, hesitating, but I end up going like "AH! What the heck!" And so I got it :p.
