不知道为什么，感觉自己好像花一样，要枯萎了。花瓣开始凋零了。自己的世界，不知为何，只是看到一片荒芜。

是以前所看到的都是幻想吗？还是一向以来都不愿承认这个事实？

这种寂寞感伤真的是非常强烈…连自己也承受不了。

体贴与关心的人很多，他们也很好。但似乎真正了解，话入心坎肺腑的好像连一个也没有。知己难得吧…

其实自己也不知如何是好。其实真的是很难说出来，毕竟这是一个自己的“感觉”，一个不知为何而来的“感觉”。或许说出来都只是被当着是“多心”来看代…

真的是开始乱了…

I don't know why, I felt I'm like a withering flower with petals starting to fall away. I don't know why, my world seems to be like a desolate plain.

Is it that what I have seen in the past is just an illusion? Or is it that I don't want to accept this reality?

This kind of depression and loneliness is very strong… even myself can't bear it.

There's a lot of kind and caring people around me, and they have been good. But it just seems that there's no one who really understands and being able to say words can touch deep down in my heart. True friends are hard to find, it seemed…

Actually I also didn't know what shall I do. And really it's very hard for me to say, after all it's one of my own "feelings" which I don't know the source. Maybe if I say it out it will only be treated as being "over sensitive"…

Feeling really confused already…
