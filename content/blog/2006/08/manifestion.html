It's been a while… finally got some extra energy to really manifest these energies to learn how to create something. Been spending some extra time to pick up programming and drawing again, and taking every chance to expose myself to real-life Japanese text. Pretty much still at the crawling phase, it's hard to say whether it is sustainable… But it's OK, one step at a time.

がんばってね～
