Sometimes it's much easier to feel negative than to be positive, it's much easier to feel sad instead of doing something about it, it's much easier to give up all hopes than to continue to strive to achieve our own peak.

Probably that also means that it's much easier to become an escapist than human…? It's indeed a long journey ahead…
