Went out of shopping, thinking that I would feel better without the pollen around. Apparently it only got worse :(, with some minor headaches, sneezes and worse, stomach discomfort.

Signals to see a doctor if that doesn't heal today. (which is most likely)

And, the reason: I need to buy the only thing in my August Mega-Sale shopping list which I haven't crossed out yet: some unders! I had been wanting to buy them for quite some time as the most major annoyances that I had with the ones I had. It's like… those were bought by my parents a long time ago (at least a few years, 2 to 5, I guess), and they really don't know the size of my family jewel when expanded. *cough cough* So it's really uncomfortable when they sorta "peep" outside. &gt;_&gt; &lt;_&lt;

And so I went to one of those specialty shops (<a href="http://www.theundershop.com/">The Under Shop</a>), but to be honest the collection is just *slightly* more than what I can usually find in the department stores.  Probably only thing special are those "specials" (you know, designer patterns and stuff), but they are probably expensive enough for me not to consider them :p.

To be honest, I really felt *very awkward* when I was cruising around in the store ^^||. I wonder whether is it those hunky models on the boxes, my own typical Eastern guy's embarrassments, the fact that I'm indeed *in* a specialty store, or not feeling all that comfortable of *knowing* there's the shop assistant around me (compared to departmental stores that there might be times when there's no staff around).

I wonder whether people can see my nervousness when I held one of those boxes XD.

The one thing I found out is that boxers are more expensive than briefs, that includes boxer briefs. It's like… for one boxer brief, you can get two or three briefs already. That's a minor let down because I was indeed planning of getting one box of those. Ah well.

But I did end up getting a week's supply of underwear that I really wanted :). Tangas was definitely my current favourite as soon as it caught my eyes. Sexy but not all too revealing :). I sort of kicked myself when I left the cash register, though. Because I didn't notice that there were briefs with meshes near the cash register. :p (I wonder how they would look like? Would really like to try those :p)

And yes, I did tried them on and they just fit just nicely, all and whole :D. That's one worry off from my brain now.
