自己到底需要多少的肯定才敢干脆的下手行动？好像好多时候因为追求“完美”而失去了它。
How much affirmation do I need in order for me to take the chance and act? Seems like a lot of times because of pursuing "perfection", I have ended up losing it.

最害怕的并非其他，最怕就是自己放弃了自己。
The thing that I'm most afraid of is not of everything else, but that I have given up on myself.
