{% mark post -%}It's been a while I haven't really rested, finding my sleep time requirement have increased over time. Having no energy to work for the past two weeks (plus?) is not something very optimistic, in a way.

Not sure whether is it by chance, by my current circumstances or that I'm just not following my living pattern these days, I found myself overslept (like… 9 o'clock in the morning @_@||). Still feeling a bit bad about it as if I'm committing job suicide X_X… anxious and nervous, even.

But just staying at home, doing nothing, reading books on my bed… it's been a while I haven't felt that refreshed before ever since I had that hectic schedule for the past two to three months. Just the peace, serenity and silence is so joyful enough that even music will become a disturbance to this experience.

It's just a very pleasant feeling, I would say :).{%- endmark %}
