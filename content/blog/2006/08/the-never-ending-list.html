OK, now "cooking" is definitely in my "to learn" list. Just being able to prepare some simple ones would do (i.e. Light cooking). But since I didn't have any personal fridge space, I wonder when is the chance…

Definitely the thing I'd would learn as soon as I move out, which is part of my own plan in a pretty distant future.

August is definitely a spending month, and I'm planning to use at most RM500 from my savings to satisfy my never-ending wish list. The Zen:Vision have to wait though… :/ as much I'm very much tempted to buy it as my music collection has hit the iPod's limit. (But my fair guess is that those CDs that I couldn't live without would probably take around 5~10GB, which is acceptable)

But at least I'm very glad to say that I'm relieved that my list wasn't as long as it were before. But don't let me see the Nintendo DS Lite + Final Fantasy III over Malaysian shores in a few month's time ^^||. Together with Final Fantasy VI, for that matter.

That would spell yet another thing for me to hoard ^^||||.
