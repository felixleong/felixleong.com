热血沸腾，克制自己的极限真的被考验到了。（似乎好像睡火山一样危险吧？）

手不时悬在半空中，似乎表现心中举棋不定的那份紧张？

看来自己真的无法自拔了－－就是那么喜欢无法捉摸的你。

Heartbeat racing, blood rushing throughout the body, the limits of my self control is already challenged to the max. (Seems almost as dangerous as a dormant volcano?)

My hands dangle in the air from time to time, seemed like it shows that situation of panicking on "what should my next move be?" deep down in my heart?

Looks like I have gone deep into it -- just so much in love with you, someone that I can't get hold of until now.
