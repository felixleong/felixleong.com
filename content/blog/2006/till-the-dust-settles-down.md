Finally~ Whole day spent and I finally get most of the work done, if not all.

It's such a dusty, dusty day that I sneezed occasionally and felt some skin irritation, but there's nothing more rewarding than a comfortable space :).

Here's my progress report :).

Computer table, now with enough space for me to actually work on stuff

Look ma! No books scattered on the floor now. (But notice that the books on the bottom shelf is arranged horizontally. I really need a new shelf sooner or later ^-^||)

The other table which used to be my junkyard was finally cleared off. Notice the bags of trash on the floor.

This is the result of 3 years of constant hoarding, luckily the are recyclable.

*(Note: Only those on the floor, right in front of the table. And probably half of the plastic stuff in the box underneath the table)*
