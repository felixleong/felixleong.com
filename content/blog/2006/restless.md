Ugh… it was a pretty bad week, it's like feeling sick for quite some time. With all the fever, throat infection, coughing, sneezing and headaches… probably that qualifies for "suffering"? Somehow it seemed that my immune system have broke down for some reasons. T-T

It became worse yesterday that I just have to take leave today just to rest and sleep. At least the good news is that I'm recovering fast…

Hopefully it gets better soon.
