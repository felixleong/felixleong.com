Somehow I'm not particularly in a good mood today… somehow the feeling of some void within was still carried forward from yesterday. Or probably I just feel like… dead? Or probably less lively? Not really sure whether stress has caught up on me.

In other news, somehow I didn't know why I'm getting so upset and irritated by a few work related call during this weekend. It's like… it's only a phone call or two which didn't really last for more than 5 minutes, I can't really think of a reason to really feel that irritated. Is it that I feel that my personal time has been invaded? Or is it that I have developed a dislike ever since the time that I felt that receiving "free computer technical support and class assignment advice calls" was very irritating?

Probably it just the fact that I was irritated when something that I feel "inconvenient" happened to me. Well, you know, it's like… wanting a life that resembles a worry-free and carefree paradise. But somehow I can't seem to find a fitting description for that said paradise ^^||.

Somehow I'm starting to ponder the question… what is the main reason that I feel irritated? What is the things that I deemed to be troublesome? What is the kind of life that I truly enjoy? What is the real difference between "duty/work" and "responsibility"? Those were the main few questions that runs in my head at the moment.

Guess it's one of those new hurdles in my own life now.
