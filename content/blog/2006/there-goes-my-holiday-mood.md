… Apparently when I really think that I do have the whole week off, it might not be the case.

Just a few days before I did mention that work may be creeping into my holidays (after receiving a few system support calls), just before Hari Raya/Eid's eve that the system suffered enough problems that causes almost all the electronic gaming tables not being able to operate.

And to be honest I was in a panic drive myself ^^||… what make it worse is that I didn't really understood the weight of the issue until my colleagues called me up. And as things turns out, I ended up not really being able to rest for the two days of Hari Raya as I find myself either being in the casino to do troubleshooting or that I'm back in the office reading log files, SQL and codes.

Not to mention that this is the first time I ever made so many phone calls.

But… I'm happy that Sze Hau had accompanied me up there. So it's like… I was there communicating with the people involved most of the time while he was there helping to track down all the problems. I wouldn't be able to track problems as fast as he could, which is one of the many things in him I really look up to.

And that I'm able to get to know a little bit more about him personally, which is definitely something very rewarding in many ways :).

…

So now I'm back home now, and guess tomorrow's another day for work.
