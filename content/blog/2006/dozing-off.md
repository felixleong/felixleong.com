The thing I'd never expect is that my antibiotics pills are the types that would make me drowsy. Which pretty much equates to a very, very sluggish day for me. Glad the boss not around today.

And thank god I have only one left, and that's for tomorrow morning. Be done and begone!

The sore throat would probably need some time to heal though :(.
