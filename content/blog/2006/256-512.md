= 768MB of RAM!

Just got myself 512 MB of RAM for my PC, and it's not that it goes without any hiccups. But I have to ask the motherboard to "tolerate" with them (as in, enabling the RAM tolerance option :p) and it just works fine :).

I'm not sure how far the speed performance will go, I didn't expect much apart from the times when my machine is on heavy load. But it's nice to have that upgraded :). (which I believe that that's what I would need for my existing compy at the moment)

At least I can have some extra fun with things that are memory hogs :p.

[P/S: Hope no one noticed that I made a math blunder :p]
