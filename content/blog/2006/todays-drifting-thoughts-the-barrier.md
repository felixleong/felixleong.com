At this blinding pace of life, I don't whether I wanted to call that barrier as a hindrance or an opportunity to growth. Or probably I'm just seeing challenges as a massive roadblock in which it's hard enough to go around it or go over it? Not sure whether I'm magnifying every single problem that I faced in life ^^||.

At the same time, I'm in an information overloading situation that I find myself extremely weighed down. Part of the reason is probably caused by my own insistence in grasping/learning too much subjects at once. Somehow reflecting on that, I was indeed doing a lot of micromanagement in my own life… laying out my own expectations on how I would like things to be.

And as time has passed, although I had reached some of these goalposts that I had set for myself, things didn't really turn out to be what I'd expect it to be. It's like… once you reached a certain goal in life, there will be other challenges that follows with it.

Thinking about it, when I have reached, are the feelings of disappointment and anxiety brought out by the difference between the result and expectation really unnecessary? Or that I'm focusing myself on the wrong question? That's indeed something for myself to ponder about. But I do have to admit that my recent insecurities, disappointments and anxiety/fear was indeed stemmed from these differences.

Think that's about it at the moment.
