Hmm… nothing much to say about today, really. But somehow just contemplating the same old stuff that I still can't find the answers to, and that I do feel like… there's a lot of things that I still have to learn: Work and life, to be more specific. And that I'm still trying to decode some hidden expressions and messages from the communication of the people close to me… somehow I just felt that there must be something valuable behind, no matter how trivial they may seem to be.

Somehow that does made me wonder whether thinking everything that happened and deep contemplation is a bit too much ^-^||. In some ways I really felt the urge to let things go and live life without restraint, I wonder what's holding me back…? ^-^||||

That's something that I'm think about at the moment. :)
