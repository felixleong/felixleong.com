一直守候在你身边，怕你我会厌烦。  
但没有你陪的时刻，自己却会心烫。

一丝丝思念的情怀，  
到底是在想你，还是只是满足自己？

其实好多好多时候，觉得不了解你。  
在黯然神伤的眼神，到底说些什么？

一段段悲痛的感觉，
到底伤心是你，还是迷惑中的自己？

一直不敢坦诚相对，怕你我会逃避。  
但没有深度的话语，自己却会叹气。

一丝丝压抑的关怀，  
到底是在隐瞒，还是只是欺骗自己？

其实好多好多时候，很想要了解你。  
在平淡无奇的生活，一起分担分享。

一段段漫长的路程，  
寻找一份勇气，坦诚和你走在一起。

…这，是我小小的心愿。

Being by your side all the time, I'm afraid both of us will get bored  
But without you by my side, I ended up getting heartaches myself

Bits and pieces of the feelings of missing you  
Is it that I'm thinking of you, or I'm just satisfying myself?

In reality, a lot of times, I feel that I don't understand you  
Behind those sorrowful eyes, what they are saying?

Bits and pieces of the feelings of sorrow  
Is it that you're sad, or the one who's actually sad is that confused me?

All awhile I really am not being completely sincere between us, fearing that one of us will end up avoiding  
But with conversations that gets only skin deep, I ended up sighing with disappointments

Bits and pieces of the supressed caring for you  
Is it that I'm trying to hide, or is it that I'm just lying to myself?

In reality, a lot of times, I really wanted to understand you  
In this normal and simple life, being able to share all the joys and sorrows

On one long journey and another,  
Finding courage, to walk with you together with complete truthfulness

… This, is one small wish that I really wanted to achieve
