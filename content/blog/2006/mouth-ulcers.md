It seems that joining the ranks of sneezes and coughs, mouth ulcers is another one of the most frequent health related problems/annoyances that I face almost once a month.

And this time round I got one big one (around 20~25mm) on the very right corner of the inner lip, and that's really no fun. As much I'm relieved that that part of the lip weren't as sensitive as the middle part of the lip (I didn't felt much pain on the ulcer, to be honest), but it really felt that as if my mouth is going to leak from the right corner.

Reminds me of the days around two decades back.

Looking it up in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth_ulcers), I really wondered whether is it my toothpaste, the recent stress levels I'm facing, or I'm just plain allergic to some foods or diet Coke (that's the official supported soft drink in the office)?

Or it's probably the old Chinese medicinal saying that I'm eating a lot of "heaty" food? Hmmâ€¦.
