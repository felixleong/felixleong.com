OK, let's put this straight: Sentimentalism *will NOT* make things better, especially on days that I have come to identify with *"romanticism"*.

Woa! Big words that I thought I'd never use in my life XD.

Anyway, somehow thoughts get drifted from time to time, but never recorded down… issues are still the same, questions remain unanswered… Still walking on the path continuing on my own journey within.

Months passed by, as I still tending my own little garden and taking good care of myself. From time to time, I feel a little bit panicky, a bit anxious, seeing that flowers were not there yet. It really took me a lot of time and effort to clear away my disappointment and anguish.

Someday, probably, flowers will bloom, eventually.
