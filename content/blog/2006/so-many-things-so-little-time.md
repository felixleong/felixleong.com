I have to admit that I really have a very, very, very short attention span ^^||, which means sustained learning efforts may be… umm, rare.

There's a lot of things that I would want to do, explore and learn, really.

Currently I'm still learning Japanese, but yet I would really want to pick up Korean some time.

I wanted to pick up some books on travelling (especially Japan), but yet I'm sort of wondering whether I should do my research on buying myself an apartment or something.

I wanna be fat (Go Go Girls? XD) yet I would love to pick up something about health and fitness as well.

Would like to spend more time drawing and writing, yet I would want to spend some time to learn some programming language as well (UNIX programming, PHP, Python, in particular)

Would really want to commit more time to understand more about people around me, but yet I need more time to understand myself as well.

I'm still wondering why I'm still having the tendency to spread myself too thin…? Hmm… -\_-||
