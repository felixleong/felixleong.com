Just got the IDE cable for my new harddrive, am now checking for any bad sectors in the drive before I unleash my grand masterplan (to plan for my own personal p0rn kingdom? MWAHAHAHA~ &gt;:p)

Anyway, rewinding back:
Not feeling very energetic today, that's enough proof that I need to head to bed early plus some happiness to go with it :). Good mood is always a energy booster :).

Later on, today's my boss' birthday and we had yummy rich chocolate cake (of course, at our own expense ^-^||)~

Dust will be flying tomorrow as we'll see our own boxes gets four floors down, hoping nothing more than a smooth transition (although in reality, this hope is always less than certain). Will be exposing ourselves to different set of people. Anxious? Of course (after all, the CEO and other top management will be sharing the same floor with us ^-^||). But it'll be another good learning experience exposing to different elements.

Other than that… well… still getting those inferior-complex fits today. Not exactly in a very high-pitched mood today (yet not low-pitched enough to give me a depression). :(

Probably I won't be around on MSN when I'm back at home for a few days, as I'll be fooling around with my new harddisk and go through all the required rituals :).
