{% mark post -%}Two days back home, just a good place to exercise my complete laziness.

Like… lying on the sofa for hours, watching anime, making trips to the fridge… Not really feeling like entertaining anyone during that time, just wanted rest completely.

Some springs were wounded too tight all this while, I suppose? Even now I still haven't feel really recharged.

Ah well…

Speaking of which, our house is almost done, all the bricks are in place, all it needs is just all the minor details which makes it beautiful instead of just being mere useful :).{%- endmark %}
