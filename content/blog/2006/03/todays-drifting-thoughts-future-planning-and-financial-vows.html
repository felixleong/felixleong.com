Roll-on deodorants that uses glass bottles could use a rubber grip by the sides. (I just broke one today in the bathroom, which is definitely a mess ^-^||)

OK, seriously…

I just came back from <a href="http://www.matta.org.my/">MATTA fair</a> just now, which is essentially the only well-known travel fair in this region. The original intent of having myself going there is to search for a good deal for my travel plan. But instead, I ended up only going there to see and grab price tags as well as having myself very shocked and a RM3* reality check.

The main focus I'm at here is probably not the price (it has a influencing factor, as we'll explore later), it's more on having my financial perceptions being stirred up. Or more straight to the point… it's like… with my current situation and commitments that I had on hand now, a holiday was definitely a great expense. Not to mention that it's seems that I can't seem to be able to afford any kind of trips overseas without sacrificing something.

Then the whole issue that I have brought up a few days ago (<a href="http://felixleong.livejournal.com/259067.html">Drifting Thoughts: Where To…?</a>) gets all exploded in my brain. Really, the real fact that "you can't have all your desires in the world, let alone having them now" is really a bitter pill to swallow down.

Then there's tons of questions that follows about future planning… or financial management, at its least. Lots of questions filled my brain like no end, the usefulness of questioning is not known, but yet the fear is so relevant that it's not something to be ignored. Like… "How much should I save to ensure for my survival for a period of time? And for how long that time will be?", "Does finances and physical possessions really matter in life?", "What's the point of getting the things that I wanted: let it be my books or CDs, or the capability to travel or owning a house or a car? Doesn't it look absurd to own for the sake of owning/getting it?"

At that time, my thoughts was like… which is more absurd? My acts of planning, or my own items of desire? Or both…? And everyone knows that life is everything but certainty. And through this confusion… I really lost sight of what's really important in life… It's like I know it but I never been able to grasp it clearly.

It's really like… the ultimate in life is beyond the physical plane, and yet, living in this reality, the physical has to be taken care of well. Hmm… paradoxes.

…

Anyway, lighter chunks of thoughts and lessons that I have gained from the fair itself:

# One of the managers of a travel agent asked me a very good question "What's the point of going to a travel fair if you aren't buying any of the great deals being offered? Especially after you came all the way here and spent the money on transport and entrance fee. Most of the information can be easily obtained from the advertisements on the papers anyway."

# One thing that I don't understand about promoters is that… is it really that awkward if I just listening to them without giving them any verbal feedback? (or probably that question applies to communicating with others, especially family and friends) This is very apparent with direct selling agents which they often persuaded me with conversations that goes like "Don't be so shy, say something.", "Let me know about your opinions", "You seemed to be indecisive"…

To be honest, as much as I understand that giving verbal feedback like asking questions or stating my point of view is very important to participate in a conversation, what's wrong of participating a conversation by just listening attentively? After all, I don't have enough information for myself to come up with any enquiries, opinions or taking a stand over certain matters, so what's the point of having myself saying things that I didn't know… or having myself to pretend that I know anything about what I think or what I want?

Is that a problem…? I definitely need some enlightenment about this. *confused*

# … that the possibility of travelling alone is a <b>very expensive affair</b> indeed. The price difference is so staggering (between 10-25% difference) that I kinda worried if I can't find a travel partner to go with @_@.

# I greatly suspect credit card promoters operate in swarms: you give in to one, the whole pack/school/herd/swarm/group follows, irregardless whether they came from rival banks.

# Most likely I'd prefer backpacking than going on via a tour… or at least getting their "Free & Easy" packages (which provides air tickets and accommodation minus the tour). At least I'm able to have the freedom to go wherever I fancy as well as saving some money… probably.

…

Anyway, probably I'll see whether any of my friends have travel plans and I think I might as well go with them for now. After all, travelling with a group is different from travelling alone or travel as a couple :). … Well, although <i><b>ideally</b></i> I would love to try travelling as a couple once ;).
