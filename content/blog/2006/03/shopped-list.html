{% mark post -%}Let's see… it's not even the beginning of April and most parts of my salary went to my expenses. Well, it's a good thing that I'm able to pay off my bills without any debt :), and not to worry about them for the rest of the month.

Went shopping today for a surge protector for my electronics (read: computers), together with a new switch and a network card which is replacing the burnt network card of my OTHER computer. Well, for one thing, I think I might not buy another Linksys product: they seemed to be waaaay too sensitive to power surges.

Then, I have been splurging money on CDs again :p. Grabbed Ayu's (miss)understood fresh from the shelves today :), then grabbed Penny Tai's Crazy Love (戴佩妮 // 爱疯了), Stephanie Sun's A Perfect Day (孙燕姿 // 完美的一天) and Fish Leong's Silkroad of Love (梁静茹 // 丝路) from the budget corner. Well, CDs of a price of RM10 to RM15 is always tempting (yeah for imports from China :p).

Gah~ My iPod is going to overflow soon &gt;_&lt;||! But looking at the bright side of things, at least I got a more varied music library now. Now I just need some more genres to fill into it…{%- endmark %}
