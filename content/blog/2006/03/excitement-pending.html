Bought myself a 250GB hard disk today, only to find out that I still need to get myself an extra IDE cable and four more screws for it when I wanted to install it into my machine <i>*sees excitement level plunges down*</i>. But anyway, will get that soon enough :), and I think it'll be a great weekend project.

Downloading stuff that I wanted to install while the hard disk sits on my desk. (more specifically Linux installation CDs)

In other news, cleared up my desk today. Now it's completely clean with minimal stuff on the table :).
