有尝试过别人要求你自己一张个人照吗？

在众多照片中选一，到底是容易，还是困难呢？似乎自己在岁月留下的痕迹中，拼命地寻觅，却找不到那一张照片。

为什么？

是照片中找不到一张表露出“理想中的自己”吗？想想下，才发现那份“理想”的片面性：只是自己“制造”给别人看的“幻觉”而已。

原来自己找不到的，不是照片；而是真正的自己。

…

你…找到自己了吗？

Have you ever been asked for a photograph of you?

Picking one from all, is it easy, or is it difficult? It seems that I searching hard for it on the traces of time, but I can't seem to find that photograph.

Why?

Is it that I can't find the one that shows my "perfect self"? Thinking about it, only to realize the partialness of that "perfectness": It's only an "illusion" "manufactured" for others to see.

What I can't find, is not the photograph; but of my true self.

…

Have you found yourself…?
