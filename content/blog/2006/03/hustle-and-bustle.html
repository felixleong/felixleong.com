Not much dust gets flown around during our office relocation, but tons of frustration that gets piled up. Nothing more frustrating than having myself unable to access the company network = I can't do my job &gt;_&lt;.

To some, it might be a blessing; but with a tight deadline around the corner, it's an absolute nightmare.

Almost the whole afternoon has seen me silently cursing with any four lettered profanity that I can possibly think of, grumbling with I get some other PC installed as a make-shift solution.

Not to mention the IT support people which takes oh-so-long to come, as much as I know they have a long waiting queue, I'm like "GOD WHAT TOOK THEM SO LONG! I WANT IT SETTLED *NOW*".

Gah!!!

Frustrated, frustrated, frustrated!

*grumbles like no end*

â€¦

Anyway, they just came. Hopefully they can solve the problem, sometimes computers are just weapons of mass frustration.
