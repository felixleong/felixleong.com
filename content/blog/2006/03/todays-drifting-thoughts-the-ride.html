Took leave today, and my emotions are like… meh ._.

It's been kind of a depressing state when I spent time reflecting on recent events… Not because that something happened, but rather the lack of it. It's really like, I sensed something is different, yet I just can't pinpoint what nor I'm able to see where that's coming from.

And there's some questions that I really wanted to ask… yet I really don't know how to ask without feeling awkward. &gt;_&lt;|| And there's more questions… about self-centered-ness and interpersonal communication and relationships. And I'm like… the more closer or intimate with someone, the harder I find myself to understand them, expressing my concerns or that not to become a burden to them.

Is it really that I can't do anything beyond? Or is it that I had the sense of fear of committing myself into participating in their life? Or is it the whole inferiority complex all over again…?

In other news, computer related pet peeves! Anyway, in short, thunderstorms killed two ports on my switch/hub and my on-board LAN port. Luckily that the other ports are still functional and that I still have a spare LAN card. You can read up the details in my technical blog if you wanted to know more about my life in general today:
