{% mark post -%}Poems have always my favourite form of creative writing, and I still remembered how much I enjoyed that format every since I was in Form 3 in secondary school :).

Browsing through <a href="http://felixleong.com/blog/tags/poem">my collections of poems</a> that I have written in LJ, as condensed that words seems to be, but the overflowing emotions are still well retained after all the time and tide I have been through.

Somehow I wonder whether these poems are that expressive, or that some things never changed? ^-^||

As I read them through, I was kind of thinking… whether is it possible to give them some form of melody to go with it? All this while, my poem writing style did somewhat resembles the structures of song lyrics (JPop/CPop), that really made me curious :).

There's a lot of stories behind these poem, that I believe that I'd never retell them as well as I do with those poems themselves. Sad most of them might be, but it did made me realised all these experiences that I have been through have made me a stronger person that I can't believe myself to be.

Will there be a time when my poems will be more upbeat? Maybe time will tell :).

Somehow this kinda remind me that Ahmed joking said that I'm like a siren once :p.
