Been facing the monitor for the whole dayâ€¦ literally.

Why? Just finalizing my Gentoo Linux project, I still need to install my graphic tablet though. Other than that everything else are pretty much trivial stuff, minor tweakings, that is.

I always wondered whether radiation from monitors would mutate my genes, though :p.
