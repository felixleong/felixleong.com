Let's see… my application to convert my study loan to scholarship was approved, which means that I have some slight financial room from now on… and probably I would need to wait a while to see whether they will refund my loan repayments in the past.

Then been spending time ripping my DVDs, I always wanted to have a backup of them, at least in encoded form and my new harddisk space allowed me to do so. But I do forsee that it'll take a while before I get them all done, so the plan is let the conversion run by itself while I'm sleeping. I didn't dare to switch on my compy when I'm off to work after a few storm related accidents and harm to my computer :X.

Will be getting some equipment when my paycheck arrives, since my expenditure this month was uncontrollable :X.

Work starts to pick up this week and I have a monster module that I needed to test. Most likely I won't be able to take a long leave until June :(. BUT~ I'm possibly thinking of going for a holiday after that, just that I need to get my finances right ;). Not sure whether I'll be able to make it to take my virgin flight this year, but we'll see how things goes. :)

I was told that Choon Hui was back from Australia two days ago. Nothing much to comment on since I didn't get to meet him up, just glad that he's still doing good in life.

Other than that, I'm just leading my normal life :).

Which is both a good thing and a boring thing, depends on how you look at it :).
