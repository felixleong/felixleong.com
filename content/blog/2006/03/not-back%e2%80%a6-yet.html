Very short story cut shorter: I work on my PC so late that when I actually go out to get the bus tickets home, it was already sold out ^-^||.

So, I'm still here in PJ, but I got the tickets for tomorrow at 9, so I definitely need to wake up early. I'll miss the mountain hiking, though, so… well, I'm guilty to admit this but it's definitely a good thing ^-^|||||.

In other news… I'm starting to dabble around with Chinese/Cantonese pop music. So been spending some time browsing through the budget corner to fish some good deals :p. The only thing now is that I'm not that good in identifying which are originals and which aren't (unlike my keen eye to avex releases XD), but that's just a matter of time, I guess ;).

So my second CPop CD in my collection is a special compilation album for Leo Ku (古巨基) and Mirriam Yeung's (杨千嬅) concert in Malaysia (back in January), 古舞飞杨 《大马演唱会纪念精选特辑》. For one thing, it's cheap :p (RM25), so I have no qualms to that (considering that albums usually cost around RM40). But… why is it that I got this album with most of the tracks are sad tracks (i.e. songs for the broken hearted)?! XDDD But then again, those in the album were their hit songs :p.

Going to sleep now, I can't afford to miss that 9 o'clock bus ^-^||.
