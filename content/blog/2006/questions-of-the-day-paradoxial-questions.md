The thing that strike me is that:

- There's no point earning and saving so much just to keep a living corpse alive later in life. But is a financial safety net is a must-have in life or that's just something that compensates for our own fears?

- What am I pursuing for? Money is known being not able to buy everything, fame and power is just a social illusion, love is not something that lasts till eternity, and nothing can be guaranteed to be attained in a spiritual enlightenment. Is it a happiness that is never attainable? Or that the act of pursuing is just an illusion has given us the impression that we are moving while we are really not?

- What is the ultimate reality? What is the real form of "Success" in life?
