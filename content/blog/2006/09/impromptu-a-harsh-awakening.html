{% mark post -%}At this moment of time… anything's possible, that's what I have constantly reminded myself. Hope and pain were intertwined in on entity: the thing that we call "the perception of time". No matter how things may be, anything could happen at this point of time, nothing's more certain than a harsh awakening.

Now I can only close my eyes… to wait… and hope…


May everyone had a good night.{%- endmark %}
