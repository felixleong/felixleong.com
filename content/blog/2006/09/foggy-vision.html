At the moment, I had somehow lost a clear sight of what I want… well, in terms of my own future advancements. My perception is foggy at the moment that I'm not sure what I want and what's my worries. It's pretty hard for me to work the equation out, probably because I'm facing something new in my own life?

Or probably my brain needs some sort of organization now? ^^||
