Sometimes I still have grave apprehension over some problems that I had, sometimes I worry myself like I'm having the end of world of some sort.

Now I'm having some issues, more specifically on sales people: well, you know, telemarketers and sales people/agents. Somehow I always feel very, very apprehensive and threaten when I'm with these people. I don't know, somehow they trying hard to sell somehow made me feel very uncomfortable and triggered a very defensive attitude towards them.

Today in particular I received a phone call from a telemarketer and it really scares me when he knew my name, phone number and my work and he claims that he got it from some sort of bank database. In the end I had the impression he said something like "OK then! I'm signing you up to this expensive service that you don't want and I'm going to charge it to your credit card straight away!" and hung up.  As much I'm very sure the fact that I never disclose my credit card numbers and there's a great possibility that he had those information from a survey or something (OK, probably I'm stupid enough to fill all these kinds of form honestly), I'm still feeling very disturbed about it.

It really made me worried and disturbed (at least in a very light degree) and I can't seem to focus on anything I'm working on. Sort of made me felt very bad for not knowing how to reject people in a very authoritative manner.
