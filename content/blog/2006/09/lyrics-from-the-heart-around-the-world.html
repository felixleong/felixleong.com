<b><u>around the world / move</u></b> [lyrics by motsu (move)]
※Trip to the world
Yo! here we go unknown world へと
生まれたばっかりの旅人
慣れない足どりもまた愛嬌　キメるとこだけバシッと!
So many people in this world
時に中傷とかもないわけじゃないけど
ツマンナイとこはWarpしてこう　筋だけは通し生きてる
That's our low!

あてのないTrip
One way ticket to your soul, let's go!
ブッ飛び続け見つけるYour goal
愛しあい時代に感じあい
さまざまなドラマつくってこう
So many thing we wanna try
Pop songの底に隠れてるDeep style
５０億の願い　渦巻くWorld　きっと誰かに届くYour light

息さえつかない　眠れない街
隙も見せずに笑いあって
嘘さえSafety　ホントがEmpty
危ないぐらいにwanna shut and break out!

(Now we gotta start Let's get move)

☆Let's move into the brand new world
Let's dive into the brand new trip
広い世界におびえてる
始まったばかりのNow we go full speed and funky beat
きっと輝く　around the world

誰かに届くまで　力強くBrand new wind
未来を描く　地図もない
愛だって恋だって　マジに出会いたいよ
It's the time to Travelin' around the world

Information　秒速で伝わる時代
でもChoiceの仕方がわからない
Money can't buy my love
なんてノンキなヤツにラリアート３回
マニュアルどおりにただ抱きあい
愛がないことに気がつかない
窒息する前に叫ぼうぜHo!!!!!!!
In the midnight dream

熱い思いを　抑えきれずに
願いは空を突き抜けてく
最後の90's　生きてるFull speed
Now I know I wanna start to move into the rhythm

（Now we gotta start Let's get move）

＊世界の果てに立ち　裸で感じたい
生まれ始めた景色たち
明日だって　夢だって　マジに出会いたいよ
It's the time to travelin' around the world

（Take it to your soul）

(Now we gotta start  Let's get move!!)

* Trip to the world
Yo! here we go into the unknown world, just-born travelers
The unfamiliar walk is still charming, you only hit the place you decided on
So many people in this world, it don't mean that at times there's maybe slander but
Let's warp past those boring parts, go straight through reason and live
That's our low

Aimless Trip
One way ticket to your soul, let's go! Keep pushing and looking for
Your goal
Feel together the times you love each other, let's make all sorts of dramas
So many things we wanna try Hiding at the bottom of a Pop song, Deep style
5 billion wishes, swirling World, surely it's (Your Light) gonna reach someone
Your light

Can't even take a breath, the city that can't sleep
Don't be off your guard but laugh at each other
Even lies are Safety, Truth is Empty
It's almost dangerous but wanna shut and break out

(Now we gotta start  Let's get move!!)

** Let's move into the brand new world
Let's dive into the brand new trip
Frightened in the gray world
We've just begun Now we go full speed and funky beat
Surely we're shining around the world

Until it reaches somebody, the powerful Brand new wind
Sketch your own future, you don't need a map
But I seriously want to meet love and affection
It's the time to Travelin' around the world

Information, it's an age that tells you speed by the second, but
Choice isn't understood
Money can't buy my love What kind of carefree guy gets roped three times
Following the manual you just hold each other, you don't notice things without love
Before you suffocate, shout out Ho!!!!!! In the midnight dream

Don't snap all control of hot feelings
Wishes pierce through the sky
At the last of the 90's, be alive Full Speed
Now I know I wanna start to move into the rhythm

(Now we gotta start  Let's get move!!)

*** I want to feel it, standing naked at the edge of the world
The landscapes that have just been born
But I seriously want to meet tomorrow and dreams
It's the time to Travelin' around the world

(take it in your soul)

**  repeat
*   repeat
**  repeat
*** repeat
