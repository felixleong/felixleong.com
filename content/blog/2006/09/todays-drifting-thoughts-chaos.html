{% mark post -%}Well, chaos not as in my life a complete ruin or mess. Everything's fine here.

But more like… how I see my present situation is more like a unpredictable and random board of chess. Not that anything bad has happen in some way or the other, but somehow… well, how should I put it… things turning out much different from what I have expected.

Or, in another way of putting it, the shattering of a planned storyline in the head, I suppose.

Somehow I'm still feeling a bit nervous somehow, it's like… I'm starting to find myself exposing to a bigger world than I thought. And looking at myself at the moment, it's like… I have been staying in my own my space for a long time, and I'm somewhat hesitant to move out the the world that I had always wanted to be.

… Somehow I had that random association of "a leap of faith" with that… But certainly, at the moment, it's pretty much the first time that I really can't foresee myself of what my future will be (all this while I did have some sort of mental image of my own future along the way).

…

Well… at this point of time, I can't really tell what will happen next. Guess I can only really see when the time comes.{%- endmark %}
