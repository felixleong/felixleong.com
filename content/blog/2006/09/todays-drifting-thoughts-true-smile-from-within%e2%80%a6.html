{% mark post -%}It's not that I'm sad or anything… it's not even that the smile on my face is fake… Somehow… on the surface of things, in a way I'm indeed happy with my own life.

But at times when I was on my own… at those times when I dwell deeper and deeper into my own being, I can't seem to find that smile deep down in my heart. I pretty much notice that what I have written down in my LJ is much more of the deeper aspect of myself, I'm starting to notice that the happy smileys that I have typed… doesn't really mean a real smile from within.

That pretty much made me noticed that there's a lot of issues that I'm not really aware of myself… is there actually some wounds that needs to be healed? Or is it that I'm still trying hard to find that flame that enlighten my whole being? At times, I really felt like an empty shell… yet I can still feel the substance within me which is so hard to catch hold of.

… Or is it really something that I'm indeed aware of it but I didn't acknowledge it…?{%- endmark %}
