Reading from a blog that the ISP that I'm using has upgraded the speed limit for some of its subscriber, I was surprised that mine was upgraded to a 2MB download/512K upload connection :D.

… But on the downside, there are some difficulties during the past few days for me to access to Google and Wikipedia. Certainly those hiccups weren't supposed to happen and that was a really big inconvenience to me. I have to resort to Yahoo! only to find out that their search results weren't as good as Google's.

Other than that, I have find myself using my graphics tablet more often. It's been a while I have really drew anything, and it's still fun as I knew it was :D.

And… I switched to another theme for LJ, using one of those defaults provided. I think it's about time for a change… Probably I'd customize it, but the idea haven't struck me yet. Probably it'd need to wait until I got a certain theme that I wanted to convey about in my own life? Well… that's something that we have to wait and see ;).
