title: Get Some Steam (Iron) :p

After getting an ironing board and a steam iron, I'm now pondering how did I survived without them for the past year :p (with a normal iron with a large table surface as my "board").

But not without some accidents though, as I didn't realized that leaving the iron horizontally would cause water leakage, which really gave me a wet mess ^-^||.

And so the manual did said that I have to keep it on its heels when I'm not using it.

I'm still kinda working out my ironing skills, by all means these should make my ironing tasks much easier and faster :).
