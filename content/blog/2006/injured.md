今天明明是和往常一样啊！为什么刚刚在车上的我突然很想哭了呢？

无明的悲伤，内心不知为何的刺痛…连自己也不晓得为什么。

…是真的受伤了吗？即使那只是一个小小的切口，还是会觉得痛吧…但似乎找不到适合的OK绷贴上去的样子。

就那么的一天，为什么一直会去期待一些令自己感到安慰的幻想－－希望从你身上得到一些温柔体贴：让我依靠在你的肩膀也好，轻轻却很稳实的握着手也好，即使是温柔几句也好…但眼看现在的状况，似乎很无理吧…虚伪的安慰解脱，我自己真的很不想要啊！

自己…真的是想要求的立场…都没有吗…？虽然不会后悔，但有时候还是会觉得难过啊！

Wasn't today just like every other day! Why I felt like crying in the car just now.

The unknown sadness and unknown pricks of the heart… Even myself don't know why was that.

…Is is really that I'm hurt? Even if it's just a small cut, the pain can still be felt, I think… but it seems that I can't find a suitable plaster to cover it up at the moment.

Just at this kind of day, why I kept on longing for some calming fantasies -- Wishing that I'm able to get some tender and care from you: Letting me to find support on your shoulder, holding hands lightly yet firmly, or even just a few kind words… But seeing the current situation, I think it was a little bit rash… Those illusionary sympathies and escape, I really don't want them.

Is is that I… really don't have… any stand of asking for anything…? Although I don't regret it, but yet sometimes I really felt disappointed!
