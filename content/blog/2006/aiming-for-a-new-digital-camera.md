Hmm… After I saw the sleek Canon Powershot S80, I was tempted to buy a new digital camera. But when the reality check steps in, the idea of actually getting one is more than a fantasy than reality at this point of time. But since I'm in the mood, I did some window shopping online and check what alternatives that I had.

And after some research, here's my top ~~5~~ 6 camera wish list (for January 2006):

Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ3
Casio Exilim EX-P505
Canon Powershot S80
Kodak DX 7590
Pentax Optio 750Z
Canon Powershot A620

My current priority is definitely solid camera build, enough custom settings to fiddle around, solid picture quality (especially under low-light conditions), image stabilizing feature (I got jerky hands, mind you), unlimited movie duration with 30fps, SD/MMC card support and, of course, it has to be below/around RM2000… and worth it :). These cameras are pretty much all-rounders that fits into those criteria.

I'm currently aiming to get it some time after my probation period is over and get a salary increment or something, if there's no accidents :p. That would probably be May/June? Hopefully I'm able to get it during that time :). Till then, I'm better off buying some fresh rechargable batteries for my trusty Kodak before CNY.
