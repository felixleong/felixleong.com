Hmm… After I saw the sleek Canon Powershot S80, I was tempted to buy a new digital camera. But when the reality check steps in, the idea of actually getting one is more than a fantasy than reality at this point of time. But since I'm in the mood, I did some window shopping online and check what alternatives that I had.

And after some research, here's my top <strike>5</strike> 6 camera wish list (for January 2006):<ol><li>Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ3</li><li>Casio Exilim EX-P505</li><li>Canon Powershot S80</li><li>Kodak DX 7590</li><li>Pentax Optio 750Z</li><li>Canon Powershot A620</li></ol>My current priority is definitely solid camera build, enough custom settings to fiddle around, solid picture quality (especially under low-light conditions), image stabilizing feature (I got jerky hands, mind you), unlimited movie duration with 30fps, SD/MMC card support and, of course, it has to be below/around RM2000… and worth it :). These cameras are pretty much all-rounders that fits into those criteria.

I'm currently aiming to get it some time after my probation period is over and get a salary increment or something, if there's no accidents :p. That would probably be May/June? Hopefully I'm able to get it during that time :). Till then, I'm better off buying some fresh rechargable batteries for my trusty Kodak before CNY.
