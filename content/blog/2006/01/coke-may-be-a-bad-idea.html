Apparently, opposing to popular belief, Coke may not be an OK drink during sickness. Apparently when the flu begins, I have that gassy sensation for the whole day that I have to burp a lot to get the air out, or that I feel like an inflated balloon which never bursts. And that continues for hours until I force myself to throw up. After that the gassy problem stopped and that I noticed that some chemical reaction had happened within my stomach which will generate gas (carbon dioxide, probably?). That reminds me of a very cool experiment in high school, the only difference is that it's not fun when the chemical reaction happens inside me.

I'm starting to recover now, after getting a flu shot from the doctor. Notes to self: Although some times it's good to let the body sort illness out by itself, don't over challenge your immune system or you'll get a breakdown instead. In simple terms, go see a doctor when required.

Or probably I'm just doctor-phobic :p.

Besides that, I think I got my credit card approved :D.
