Will be going back to Kuala Kangsar (my hometown) for Chinese New Year later at 6pm MYT. I won't be updating much for the next week as I foresee that I'll be really busy especially on the first few days of Chinese New Year :).

Will post updates and photographs once I get back on 5 Febuary ;).

Other than that, today's a busy day as I sort through all the bills and finances. Getting a new set of rechargeable batteries later, hopefully they will work on my digital camera or I'll have myself stuck with the not-so-environmentally-friendly alkalines :p.
