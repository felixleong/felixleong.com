{% mark post -%}Hmm… to me, it's just a simple celebration, since I'm celebrating it on my own, basically that calls for self indulgence :p.

Anyway, got myself pizza for the new year's eve dinner. Starting a fresh year by going to working out at the gym, then later on I went to buy one more set of new clothes for Chinese New Year… and returned empty handed ~_~||. I can't seem to find anything that I really liked there, but I'm going out tomorrow so hope there's one awaiting for my attention :p.

I managed to get myself a wallet chain for my first set of clothes :), which is the final touch to it.

Later on I got my hair cut again and I'm back to my more energetic, spiked short hair look. Only this time I'm back with my natural hair colour :).

Then my plans is to continue to work on my web page design stuff and complete my 2005 review :). Phew~ What a day~ :){%- endmark %}
