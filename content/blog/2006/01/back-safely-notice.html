I'm back home after a 4 hour ride + traffic jam :). Having a very slooooooow connection here (14.4K, geez!)~

Got into our "temporary" shelter today (aka my uncle's ex-house) while my real home was now in shambles, making way for a new home to be built on the same plot of land. Getting used to the new home isn't much a problem, just that the only problem is that I don't know where everything is kept now. Guess that just needs time relearning and adjusting myself :).

The new home is expected to be completed around March, by the way.
