I was reminded the words that I had penned for this artwork three years ago:
<u><b>纯</b></u>
脱下沉重的包袱
让一切回归原点
当心灵清醒之时
重新体验简单美

<u><b>Simplicity</b></u>
Taking away the heavy burden
Let everything return back to it's origin
When the heart and soul awakens
Re-experience the beauty of simplicity

I can't remember exactly how I got that idea from, nor I remembered whether I understood what I'm actually writing and how I actually felt during that time. But I know it held a lot of significance to me during that period. Now, looking at the very same words, it really fits into what I'm actually feeling now: a very indescribable, subtle feeling that probably even I myself will not understand.

Flipping through my own LJ entries in the past, it seems that a lot of these small little quotes that I have written myself are somewhat like small little prophesies -- in which sentences with few words has suddenly expands its own dimension, creating new meaning, a new experience unto itself. Is it coincidence? Or is it something else? Probably I will never be sure.

All of a sudden… I felt as if I have found myself liberation: breaking away from my very own chains that I have chained myself with.

…

Anyway, this is one of my proudest artwork that I had made. And now it holds a much more greater meaning to me, both technically and spiritually. And thinking back, I believe this is actually an idea for a novel that I wished to write actually, that was three years ago, though :).

lyrics that become self-prophesies,
coincidences that remind me of my destiny,
voices of singers long gone.

They tell me that whichever path I choose
will take me home."</div>
