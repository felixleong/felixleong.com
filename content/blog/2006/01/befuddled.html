Just one of those really confusing days that I find myself dumbfounded in many aspects. Nothing major happening actually, but the events today just caught me off guard today that I felt as if a big star has fallen on my head and I find myself spinning in circles (Hmmmâ€¦ FF7 Confuse spell?).

Gah! Just feeling so confused that I don't know what's happening with me now X_X||.
