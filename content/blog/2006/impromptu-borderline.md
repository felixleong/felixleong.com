或许是觉得自己不值得被爱，所以才会无形中为自己画个界线，等着喜欢的人会越界吧!

…这也反映着我也是不敢越界的人吧！

Maybe I felt that I'm not worthy to be love, therefore I have drawn a borderline around myself unconsciously, waiting for the one I liked to cross it!

… This also reflects the fact that I'm one of those person who didn't dare to cross other people's territory!
