Imagine you are just an ant, wandering around in search of food. And, apparently, you crawl onto a living carrier (a human, for example) unknowingly and was carried away to a very distant place.

What would you feel if you are crawled on unknown grounds… all alone? What would you do…?

Apparently that's what I was thinking when I see that ant moving around aimlessly on my office desk.
