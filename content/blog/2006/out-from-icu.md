Yup, it's my brother all right. Just got the news from my mom that he has been transfered to the normal ward today and it is estimated that he'll dispatched home two to three days later.

Other than that relieving news, I'm quite busy these few days as I sort things out a little. That depressing three-month old project is coming to an end soon (hopefully) and gosh that was an experience. Now I just need to settle some paperwork, do some formal testing and I can focus on something else. But one thing for sure is that I learnt quite a lot from there :).

That's about it.
