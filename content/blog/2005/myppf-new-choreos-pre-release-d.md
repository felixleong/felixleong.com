Yay! The filming goes extremely well ^^v.It's like, I'm getting better at adjusting my camera and stuff. (Yay for self-filmed para videos which DOESN'T suck XDDD)

Originally I'm planning to ask Phil to do the video editing, but as it turns out I got a bunch of LARGE files (200MB-ish) which will probably take me ages to upload them over a server on dialup (or even my school's Internet, which is pretty sluggish lately) >.<". Boo ;\_\_\_\_;, I want broadband… NOW!

Anyway, I did do some simple editing, just to make them look a little bit nicer. Somehow it just turns out that it looks very similar to the videos to PPN XDDD. Oops! :p

Anyway, 4 spanking new choreographs is ready for uploading. I think I'll be uploading them tomorrow at school, at least the small WMVs. But as a special surprise, I'm throwing one in as a pre-release ^^. OK, maybe not, just want to get some feedback on the -Experimental Groove- version. As mentioned previously, I have been thinking of new ideas to incorporate in my choreography and I'm trying to make some of these dance which really deviates from my usual style (aside from the "Easy to learn" philosophy). So this is my first MYPPF-EG dance:

**Hello / Pamsy [MYPPF -Experimental Groove- Version]**

(Ahmed, I know you want this ;) ).

[note: I do noticed that the hands get cut off on the top sometimes during the sabi, but probably you'll able to make the moves out since I don't feel like re-film them under the scorching sun >.<]

Just to add on, I wore my Fire and Ice style clothes for filming ;). And I do have other surprises for my other videos ^^b. So hope you enjoy it… and stay tune for the actual release! :D
