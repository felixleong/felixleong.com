These came into the mail today :)

!['New CD collections'](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/albums/newcd.jpg){: .img-responsive}

Kinda disappointed that SEB presents J-Euro Collections are radio edits instead of extended mix (ARGH~ I want the extended mix for Karen's Nothing's Gonna Take My Love From You). But anyway, still need to listen them through ^^.

Will be taking another CD collection collage once the last CD get through the mail (J-Euro Collection Vol.1)~

[:: UPDATE ::]

The CDs are great :D. My current favourite track is definitely Something In My House / Dead or Alive (the last track from Super Euro Zip), the song is really spooky, or maybe I just love the lyrics :). But the melody and the vocals are really great in this song. Not to mention that it's not from the major Eurobeat labels under SEB. A definite choreo from me ^^.

Anyway, the lyrics:

**Something In My House / Dead or Alive**

> [from Dead Or Alive's Official Site: http://www.deadoralive.net/index.html]
> 
> I am being haunted  
>   
> I am here all by myself  
> I am here all by myself  
> And you're somewhere else  
> With someone else  
>   
> It's four o'clock in the morning  
> And I'm sitting on my bed  
> and there's banging round the bedroom  
> Nobody knows there's no one there  
>   
> I am here all by myself  
> and you're somewhere else  
> With someone else  
> I am being haunted  
> By a love that isn't there  
>   
> (Chorus)  
> There is something in my house  
> It's just the ghost of a long  
> Long dead affair  
> There is something in my house  
> I just keep a-hearing you  
> Runnin' round my stairs  
> But you're not there  
>   
> I really got to hand it to you  
> You showed me a good time  
> But for every minute that we've spent laughin'  
>   
> There were hours that I cried  
> And I've  
> And I've never meant that wicked way  
> But my heart broke into pieces  
> At midnight  
> One Hallowe'en  
>   
> (Chorus)  

Note: Hmm… the song is in Dead or Alive's Evolution: The Hits, which I believe I saw it in the CD shop I frequent, probably I would want to check that out and put it in my wish list.

Post later ^^.
