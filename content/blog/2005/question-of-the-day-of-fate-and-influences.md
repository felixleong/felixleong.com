title: Question of The Day: Of Fate And Influences

Somehow I'm experiencing one of the most mystifying experience in my whole life that I really don't know whether I should take this seriously or not (regardless whether it is actually true or not, but normally I'll take whatever people say as the truth by default with a pinch of salt. Of course unless I sense untruthfulness in someone).

Personally due to my fear of some superstitions which is unknown to me, I'm not giving away what is happening which came out with my question for today. But I believe just stating what I'm feeling now as a question shouldn't be much a problem seeing that it will not bring harm to others. Anyway, the question I would like to pose here is really something that relates to what's beyond science, perhaps to a point of being a bit far-fetched: Does lucky stars actually exists? You know, whether do you have a certain experience that when something special (be it people or some sort of a lucky charm or sorts) came into existence into your own life, everything changes completely as if Lady Luck is by your side? Personally I'm much more into subscribing to the thought that it's just a mere coincidence of events, or more like a consequence of one's action in the past. But somehow the concept of "luck" and what is the events which are beyond our own control (as in godsend or its inverse, in one way) is something that we can't deny. I do have strong belief that "What is faith if fate is unchangable?", but my own question isâ€¦ how much control or the lack of it do we have in our own lives?

Somehow I believe that the questions I posed can't actually be answered. But I'm still pondering at the thought that "This is because in life,whatever one does has some potential to influence the next event coming into one's life."

I DO have to admit that I'm completely dumb-struck right now that I really don't know how should I respond to that (just to clarify, nothing special happen to me as I still continue with my own normal life. Just something special has happened around me that I couldn't believe that what is told to me is the truth) But nevertheless I'm not disturbed by it at all (worried, yes; but disturbed, no), in fact for some unknown reasons I fell happy about it.

Guess that's about it :).
