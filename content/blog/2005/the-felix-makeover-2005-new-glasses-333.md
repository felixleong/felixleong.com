ハンサムでしょう？ :p

Bwee~ Just got my new specs. :) Honestly speaking when I first got it this morning and tried it, I didn't really liked it at first though :p. Probably the feeling I had yesterday has carried forward, I guess. But after a while when my mood picked up later, I found myself looking in the mirror once too many. :p

I suppose what makes you feel good and *ahem* handsome is perhaps a great mood ;). Ah~ I just love that feeling of confidence. Of course, knowing what kind of mood I'm having yesterday and what I felt, I suppose I need to keep that attitude myself :).

On a personal note, well… probably I'm still clinging on to what I'm not able to own (well, you know what I mean)… which somewhat does drag my mood down once in a while… But I know I'll still keep on trying, and at the same time I do need to learn how to open my eyes a bit and explore new possibilities.

Ah~~!!! I guess I better don't spoil this excitement I'm having now! :) Here's more pictures~~~ <333
