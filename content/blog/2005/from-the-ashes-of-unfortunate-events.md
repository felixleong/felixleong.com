Anyway, I forgot to mention something except for the sheer amount of pills I have to take for the next few days (which is almost close to 15, triple to what I usually have to take as dietary supplements): I just got my final semester results and I'm really proud with it :). Here's the rundown:

- Combinatronics: B+
- Parallel Processing: A
- Virtual Reality: A-
- Final Year Project: A
