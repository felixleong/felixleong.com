Yes I&apos;m safely at home now, enjoying the warmth and relaxation back at home :). Probably I&apos;m lucky enough to have several homes, but the one that I have live in for almost two decades is always the most special and important to me. Guess I&apos;m just lucky enough to have my parents.

I think I&apos;ll be going out today, it&apos;s been a while since I last went to Ipoh. Let&apos;s see whether there&apos;s any one paraing there, kinda miss the physical exercise that I have been missing for the past few weeks.
