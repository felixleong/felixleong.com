I&apos;m starting to learn one of the harshest lesson in my working life: Never leave your pen in the pocket of your shirt. And yes that means that my shirt got stained by blue ink after retrieving it from the washing machine. Any good household tips of getting rid of it? (Hairspray, as recommended by my aunt, does work, but the only thing is that it still refuses to go off completely)

Or probably I should buy myself a new shirt… hmmm… But I would really appreciate if I&apos;m able to find a way to save that money.

In other news, my progress at work is still kinda bumpy, as much as I&apos;m starting to get the hang of it. And so the stress is still there, but I believe that I need to cope with it in some way or the other ;).
