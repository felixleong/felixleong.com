{% mark post -%}Woa~ Time does flies :). I&apos;ll be reporting for work tomorrow. Kinda nervous actually.

Yesterday has been a little bit tiring as I shop for formal working clothes (you know, shirts and slacks). As I shop for them, I&apos;m kinda tempted to get some really sexy undies to go with it, but I held back after reassessing my wallet :p. Probably I&apos;ll get them next time :).

Guess that&apos;s pretty much it. I&apos;m hoping the best for tomorrow :).{%- endmark %}
