Nothing much happened during the weekends except the fact that I have been spending time relaxing at home. OK, probably not as I did mentioned that I went to Ipoh yesterday :). But then again I only went there for the PPP 1st Mix Plus machine and I do need my workout badly :p. To my surprise is that the price has dropped back to 50 cents for 3 songs, so that&apos;s definitely a great deal as I have been spending hours there playing. Not to mention the attention I get (*cough* WHORE! XD). As much as I&apos;m kinda disappointed that no paralist were there, but at least I get to talk with people and get to know some new friends, and that&apos;s pretty fun actually :).

But later on, my emotions goes for a sudden dip for no apparent reason, and that gave me a lot of room to rethink some of my principles and wondered whether do I need to make any extra ammendments to it. But off and on, some of my memories got retriggered and honestly speaking I can&apos;t bear some of the emotional pain. But thinking about it, it&apos;s like I have been asking the same questions again and again, and I do wondered whether all my effort of letting my thoughts drift are actually worth it. (As much I do know that they really paid off) Probably sometimes when you forget the joy that the thoughts have brought you, I start to doubt some of the key principles which brought me to who I am now.

Third week on the job, still not anywhere from being anywhere easier. Hopefully I can make it :).
