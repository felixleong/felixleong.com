New work, new environment, and I really SWEAR that my absent-mindedness needs a cure desperately!

More challenges ahead of me as I found myself in several odd and embarrassing situations while I&apos;m still trying to adapt with the things around me. The worst part is that I slept in the office and I got caught by my boss O_O". Luckily he took it with a sense of humour but GOD I&apos;m so embarrassed about it. Must sleep earlier this time round.

As I&apos;m entering my second day, I still have a very high mountain to climb up as I need to learn as soon as possible so that I can be anywhere from being slightly productive to the company. But for now I&apos;m just glad enough that my colleagues are extremely friendly and helpful ^^. Hopefully I&apos;ll be able to contribute something soon!

<b>[edit]</b>
Oh yeah, I suppose this should give you an idea how I look like in formal wear :)
