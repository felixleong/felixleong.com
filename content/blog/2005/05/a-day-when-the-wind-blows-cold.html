OK, the title has <b>nothing</b> to do with my emotional state, but I was literally describing the weather today as the wind blows really strong today this afternoon. It almost seems like a typhoon is coming as the violent gush of cold wind blows through any opening window that it can enter. Although it wasn&apos;t as strong to the point of blowing anything flying around the place, but the cold is greatly unbearable that I have to go to my room with all my windows shut tight.

As for my dayâ€¦ well, things are a little bit unproductive, but it&apos;s pretty good for a time when I&apos;m feeling slightly tired throughout the day. And by any chance, tomorrow&apos;s another day :).
