## NOTHING CHANGED / NORMA SHEFFIELD

You and I, thinking of all the times we spent together  
Everyday seems to me,  
Like a waking dream, a picture of perfection  
But gradually, as time goes by, seems your love was lost its lustre  
With your eyes full of doubt, your suspicions aroused, your voice is full of tension

Recently you've been pouting, accusing me of unkindness  
Tell me, how could you believe  
I would ever hurt you so please listen to what I say

\* I will protect you, don't you forget it, your love means the world to me boy  
You are my angel, nothing will changed that, your love is what keeps me strong boy  
Love is forever, time is a healer, let's welcome the joy to come boy  
Deeper & deeper, sweeter & sweeter, together we'll build a future that lasts

Losing sight of the precious things that made us special  
Petty quarrels all day, see our tempers are frayed, rejection & depression  
Clever words and conversation won't save us from this heartache  
There's a far better way to expressing ourselves, I'll hold you oh so tightly

We've both been playing games let's give fighting a rest now  
Turn our backs on the past, we'll forget all the pain, the good times are here to stay

(Repeat \*)

Now it takes the top spot of my favourite songs list. :) Norma's voice is so mellow, yet so powerful that really adds a lot of emotions to the song itself. There's a male version as well, sung by Dave Rodgers, but his rendition will never make me cry :p.
