title: Question of The Day: Anguish

Is it really that important to get everything my way? Is it really that great that nothing bad happens?

Why the frustration? Is it that I'm unable to achieve what I wanted? Or is it that I'm feeling the anguish of how the external factors are out of my control?

Is it because that I feel defeated? Or is it that I'm swallowing the sour grape while I take no action to get what I wanted?

What is the difference between one's desires and one's life long goals? What's the real meaning of hope…?

Somehow I'm feeling schizophrenic: As I feel like what I act differs from what I think/feel in my heart, especially those that involves the things that I cared for the most. Sometimes I feel like I had never earned any trust at all… myself included. Why all the insecurities…? What is it that I always made myself feeling so weak when I wanted to achieve the things that I wanted the most?
