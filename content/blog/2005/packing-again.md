Just packed my stuff, going up to Genting Highlands tomorrow, staying there for a whole week. Period.

Note to self: Next time, remember to buy travel size shampoo and conditioner. Probably hair gel as well. Meh… .\_.

Probably will be feeling ~~alone~~ lonely for a few days, but I'm sure I'll be fine. Definitely needs to learn how to loosen up some heart strings.

Anyway, Koda Kumi's Best ~first things~ have its first run. It's a great album, although I do have to say that it really reminds me of Namie Amuro :p. Probably it's the music style and her voice. Honestly speaking although the tracks are solid, I can't really remember any tracks that I can actually recall or stood out (real Emotions and 1000の言葉 doesn't count because I have heard them before in my FFX-2 OST ^-^"). Probably it would need a few runs before they would sink in.

Or probably it's only me being overloaded by the sheer number of music that I have been listening to XDDD.
