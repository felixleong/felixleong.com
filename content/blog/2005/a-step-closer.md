Phew! What a tiring day. Honestly speaking this first experience in job application does somewhat overwhelming me to the point that I have been commented by various people I met along the way that I looked tensed, nervous and/or absent-minded XDDD. But luckily everything went on pretty smoothly.

So basically I just went to the company's HR department and obtain all the documents that I needed to fill up for my first ever job application, then later on I proceed in opening a bank account and doing my medical checkup as required for the job. And honestly speaking, as much I don't actually feel nervous, but a lot of times I just found myself a lost of words as I clumsily proceed with all these procedures that I'm totally unfamiliar with. But I consider myself extremely lucky as the staff members whom I'm engaged with were extremely friendly and patient enough to get everything done without much problems.

Somehow it suddenly occurred to me that when I was walking my way back, I suddenly found that the surroundings that I thought I was really familiar with has suddenly became unfamiliar. Umm… OK, probably that's a little bit complex. Just some side info, in the past, I'm quite familiar with the routes around my company's building as I usually pass through them when I wanted to go to some major shopping areas close to it. And all this while I kinda perceived that I already know this place. Then suddenly when I knew that I'll be working around here, it just came to me that I only knew that much: after the thoughts of where can I get the cheapest food around, where is the stores are located, etc. came to my mind. And I have no clue to those questions.

Thinking about it, it's really like I'm getting into a whole new territory after I accepted this job letter. Thinking about all the changes involved does seem to be kinda scary, you know: new people, new places, new environment, new social expectations, new lifestyle… new everything. But I suppose I have to learn how to adapt to it. After all, I guess it would be the same thing if I were to continue my studies overseas (which is definitely in my plans). :)

So that's about it for today.

Speaking of which, on the lighter note, I just found a shop which sell men's accessories, and I found quite a lot of cool stuff which I would want to have :). Probably thinking of buying a few set of cool clothes for a different look :).
