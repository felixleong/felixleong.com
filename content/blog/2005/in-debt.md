Finally I found myself in the situation I dreaded: I'm now in debt!

Now with around ~~20~~ 24 grands in study loans and "owing" myself RM500 (i.e. taken from my savings account), I kinda scratch my head to think of how to draw an equal sign within a managable period of time.

The reality check is NOW X\_X||. I better keep my hands off from eBay and other shopping sites.
