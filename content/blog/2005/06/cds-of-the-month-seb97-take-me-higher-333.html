These two albums mean a lot to me as I remembered that my first favourite Eurobeat artist is Dave Rodgers, and the bonus disc of SEB97 has the most powerful Eurobeat tunes in extended format! :D (Cherry&apos;s Yesterday <333) I guess I&apos;ll be having my headphones on for quite some time these days :).

Anyway, today&apos;s maryadavies birthday! :D All my best wishes for the coming years to you! :)
