{% mark post -%}W00t! :D The karaoke outing is really fun! Just a recap, I went for a karaoke outing of seven persons, which includes two of my friends (cum colleague, I think I&apos;ll refer them as "friends" from now on :) ), Sook Lan and Sze Hau. Spending three hours of quality entertainment time does gave me a great sense of fun as well as a dry throat. What really excites me is that Red Box (the karaoke that we went to) have some newer Ayu songs, namely CAROLS and Moments :). So I&apos;m in a Ayu singing craze when I was there :D. But currently I would really want to explore some English and Chinese pop songs to sing, it would be much fun with a broader selection of songs that I could sing (and, after all, the selection of JPop is very, VERY limited. I really wished that at least they had songs from Every Little Thing, BoA and Namie Amuro D: )

Later, back at home, I have been doing some ironing, which I&apos;m very unfortunate to have my iron too hot for my office clothes, which cause a minor patch of "shrinking" D:. Luckily it wasn&apos;t really visible as the patch is situated would be tucked into the slacks, but then it&apos;s not really a good sight either. Moral of the story, keep tabs with the iron temperature, and iron the ones that only needs a lower temperature first (not the other way round!).

Later in the evening, I decided to clean the windows. Honestly they ought to be cleaned sooner because I definitely have forgotten when I last cleaned them (Umm… probably a year or an extra half?). And so I spent about two hours to get those accumulating dust off from the glass, and those windows are REALLY dusty as I notice that even after 3 rounds of repeated cleaning, not only with water but also with a cleaning agent, there&apos;s still dust sticking on the glass! Here&apos;s the proof:

Imagine how much dust that the windows has been coated with. But I did a final dry buff to the glass and now it&apos;s sparkling clean! :D It&apos;s like when I look out the window, it&apos;s like everything is crystal clear! :D Wow!

Lastly, well… I have just finished <i>The One Minute Millionaire</i> by Mark Victor Hansen & Robert Allen. It&apos;s really an inspiring and probably unconventional read about personal money management. What really appeals to me is that it ties in sound financial principles with a strong emphasis of integrity, charity and spirituality. I&apos;m not sure how much it&apos;d help, but I strongly recommend anyone to pick this book up, even if you aren&apos;t really into financial books (besides, it&apos;s two books in one: the left pages consists of financial principles, and the right pages containing a very touching and inspiring story of a single mother who have to earn her first million in 90 days in order to reclaim her children back).

Now having read two financial books in one week, I think I&apos;ll taking <i>Zen and Japanese Culture</i> by Daisetz T. Suzuki with me tomorrow. Or probably I&apos;ll take <i>The Leader In You</i> by Dale Carnegie & Associates, Inc.

Bookworm, I am :p.{%- endmark %}
