{% mark post -%}All of a sudden it just seems that there&apos;s a sickness monster hiding somewhere in my office. And so it goes that ever since last week, my colleague got struck with sickness one by one in a continuous fashion. If collapsing can be used to describe somebody gotten ill, probably this situation can be described as the "Domino Effect". Heh :p.

In other news, I woke up today having a minor back pain on the right side of my waist, which proves to be much more of an annoyance to me as I try to do anything that involves streching the muscles around the waist. Ouchâ€¦

OK! Back to work!{%- endmark %}
