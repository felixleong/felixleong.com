Let&apos;s see, some minor news:
- The registration of MYPPF.net domain is not without minor hiccups, due to my careless mistake (by keying in the wrong debit card expiry date XDDD) two days ago and some email communication blunders on my part. But everything is settled now, so~ that means that MYPPF is going official :D… well… after the site gets online, anyway :p.

- Paycheck arrived yesterday :). Honestly speaking I heard a lot of excitement of getting their intial paychecks, but after doing the math with my own planned expenses pegs and everything, it boils down to a very uninteresting amount of extra cash. But nevertheless I&apos;m still happy with it :), as I&apos;m lucky enough to have extra cash for me to spend for entertainment.

Currently I&apos;m trying to adopt the living expenses account, with me jotting down every cent that goes out from my wallet. I&apos;m not sure whether I&apos;m able to keep this habit up, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll give some insights on where all my money went :).

- I have been waking up late these few days, probably meaning that I have a lot of sleep debt to be paid back. I might be taking my weekends off to get some quality rest (as in going out less). And probably it&apos;ll also give me time to play Grandia II and work on my site ;).

- As not mentioned in my previous entries, I do have some life-long goals that I haven&apos;t actually set a deadline to achieve them, but since I don&apos;t have much knowledge in attaining them, I guess it wouldn&apos;t hurt for me to gather information along the way :) :
# Going to the US and Japan for some international parapara fun :)
# Travelling to some places around the world and stay for a week or two, so to get some surface understanding of living in those places and their culture
# Doing my masters overseas
# Getting my dream home

- Been changing some language settings of some sites to Japanese so that I get more exposure to the language :). Hopefully it&apos;ll let me learn my Japanese at a much faster and practical pace.

- In the news, homosexuals (and probably their couples) have a good reason to migrate to Canada as the Canadian House of Commons passed Bill-C38, the Civil Marriage Act, which will make same-sex marriages legal once the bill receives royal assent. For more information, check these sites:
