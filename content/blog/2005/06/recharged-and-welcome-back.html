{% mark post -%}Just went back to my parents&apos; place during the weekend, although I was expecting some relaxation, but in the end it turns out to be quite the opposite as I find myself going out places to meet up with some of my high school friends :). But it has been good times.

Well… honestly I wouldn&apos;t say everything is great for me as I just feel that everything back here has changed… it wasn&apos;t the same feeling anymore when I talked to some friends. But my sister said something that really put things into perspective "… Or is it I&apos;m the one who has changed?". Hmm…

Coming back, we celebrated Father&apos;s Day yesterday by having dinner at a nice restaurant. Originally I was the one who is supposed to treat my dad, but in the end it&apos;s the reverse as my dad wanted to celebrate for me getting good results on the final semester. :)

And now I&apos;m back in my office, coming back into the position which I&apos;m responsible of :). I&apos;m sure there&apos;s more challenges ahead of me this time round.

Oh yeah! I dyed my hair black yesterday with the help of my sister. I really liked it and I have been having the "Welcome back" feeling. Well… probably because I did said to myself that I&apos;ll get my hair back to black  when I have found myself… I don&apos;t know, somehow it does seems that I have the tendency to put symbolic meanings to the things around me. But I&apos;ll definitely dye my hair again when I feel like it, now it&apos;s much more of a personal image thingy than anything seriously important/symbolic. :)

That&apos;s pretty much it!{%- endmark %}
