Somehow I just feel as if everything is different, and yet everything is still the same.

I don&apos;t know, there&apos;ll be some definite changes in my life. I&apos;ll be having my room all by myself again next week, that&apos;s the most major one. My results will be out sometime in mid-June (I guess), and I wonder how I fared…

In the cycle of emotional calm and chaos, a sense of peacefulness seems to assure me that everything should be OK, no matter what comes.

There are a lot of things that I doubt about myself, there are a lot of things that I don&apos;t understand about myself… as I just stare at the blue sky on the top of my head.

I kept wondering… what my future goes? Where am I heading to? How should I find what I sought? Thoughts seems to swarm my brain and yet all I heard was silence… not dead silent, but just… silence.

This will be my thoughts for now. And no, it wasn&apos;t meant to be cryptic, probably poetic :p.
