{% mark post -%}Just out of some sort of excitement I finally get to realize one of my smaller dreams of commitment: getting a .com for myself :). So now I have just paid for felixleong.com, it will take around 24-72 hours before it gets live, but then again I have nothing to post on that site just yet :p.

This should give me enough motivation to start my own web project that I always wanted to expand :). (my manga drawing tutorial site, Felix Leong:PEDAGOGIES, being part of that big project)

In other news, I just finished with cleaning the window grills, which the dust count in my room has dropped significantly. Currently planning to clear up my computer table area, and I will post before and after pictures once I got everything done :).{%- endmark %}
