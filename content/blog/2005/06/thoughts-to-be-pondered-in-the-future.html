Currently I really feel like exploring some other areas in my own life and pondering some of the more harder thoughts that I have previously put aside. One of them being the concept of fear and self-confidence. Personally I haven&apos;t really see my own "fear" eye-to-eye: In most cases I would have tried my best to avoid it. My own fear isn&apos;t a fear of something really dangerous or scary, but of those which is much more closer to our own being: Fear of commitment, fear that arise due to inferiority complex, fear of losing the things that is the most important and we love most… These kinds of "soft fear" (in my own terminology, of course).

Just as a sidenote, I have been exposed into some of the Freudian concepts lately and the brief history of Sigmund Freud really caught my attention. I think I should find some time to read some of his stuff, or probably a book regarding psychoanalysis.

For those who would want to know what sparked my interest:

Anyway, nothing much had happened in my working life, but getting to know my colleagues a bit better does make the experience enjoyable. But for now… my research project due is closing in. ^^"
