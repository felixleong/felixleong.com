I just want to keep this posted as a public declaration of commitment on my part, as well as a reminder of my own goals that I wanted to achieve in the future:

As much as I have to admit that I am anxious of the change that this plan will brought forth, and that I fear that the plan will not work the way that I intended it to be, I have a strong faith in myself that I am able to do whatever necessary, in a way that it&apos;ll not bring harm to others, to achieve the things that I pursue, and that I&apos;ll commit totally to whatever responsibilities that I had on hand now (including, but not limiting to, work, family, friends, etc.) as well as those brought forth as a result of the execution of my own future plans. And as an additional requirement, I&apos;ll also commit part of my efforts towards the charity and welfare of others.

May the strength be with me always.


<b>Plans for 2005</b>
- Complete the basic framework for two of my sites: FelixLeong.com (personal website) and MYPPF.net (Malaysian Parapara Fantasy), which should include at least all the content inherited from my past works together with a flexible site building framework for me to update my site with ease
- Learn Japanese to a level that I&apos;m able to at least read, write and converse in basic Japanese (which, by definition, means that I&apos;m able to go around and understand materials meant for elementary pupils in Japan)
- Attain an asset of RM10,000

<b>Extra, Optional Plans</b>
- Continue with my research project on finger mouse and enhance at least the background subtraction algorithm to be more reliable in an indoor environment
- Learn to read and write basic Latin
- Proceed with other research endeavours in computer programming, including game programming, Windows API programming and .NET development
