Just got my marked research project back from my boss, and truth to be told, it&apos;s not beautiful at all as major portions of my answer paper got the red ink: which looks as if it was badly tainted by blood after a kill. And boy it&apos;s not only a bad sight, it&apos;s downright dreadful.

OK, it may not seem that bad as it&apos;s a 5.5 out of 10, but by my oridinary standards this is as good as disaster. The only time when I tolerate this kind of standard is that when I don&apos;t really liked something.

But for some reasons, I don&apos;t really feel hurt to a point of crying. I still remember vividly how all the small failures would make me break down to tears. Yes, I do feel hurt now, but somehow I just got over with it and feel as if I can get up straight away and move on. In fact I can daresay that this has already become my own motivation to become a better person.

I don&apos;t know, probably learning from past hurts and pain is a part of growing up? From what I&apos;m able to see from here, it seems that I have a long journey to go, more challenges to face and more experiences to be gained. But I&apos;m really looking forward to that :).
