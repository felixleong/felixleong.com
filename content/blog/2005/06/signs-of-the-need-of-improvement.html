Today had been a very jerky day to me as I find myself stumbling through the day with some communication problem on my part. Honestly speaking there&apos;s no big problem that arise from it, but sometimes I just feel a bit left out, inferior and frustrated when I can&apos;t seem to voice my thoughts out well as well as trying to get in tuned with the conversation that is going on. At times like this I really get kinda jealous with those with good communication skills like my friends (cum colleague) Sook Lan and Eng Lee (I suppose it&apos;s a good time for me to introduce a few more people in my own life :) ).

But seeing that I&apos;m not gifted in this department, I guess tomorrow&apos;s another day for me to get more social practice (and technical ones as well, since I do feel that I&apos;m still very slow in picking up the pace at workâ€¦ probably to a point of falling behind). Does sounds like I have a long way to go in learning about life :).

[Update: Just as a sidenote, my receipt for my domain name registration came in today, so that means that *hopefully* the "Under Construction" page will be up soon :). But that&apos;s a big hopeful on my part, but rest assured that I only need to wait at most 3 days ;)]
