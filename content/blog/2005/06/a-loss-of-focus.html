It&apos;s been four days now after my dreaded sickness and now I&apos;m still having some really bad stomach pain today which slightly affect my own well-being. I find myself cursing at it a lot and prayed that I&apos;ll get better ASAP. (Hopefully…)

And due to my own lack of appetite, it does seems that my glucose intake is insufficient for my brain activity, which makes me hard to concentrate as well as having the dizzy sensation. Bleh…

In other news, my convocation date is set at 6 August 2005, and this time round I&apos;ll make sure I&apos;ll attend it with my family (since I missed my college graduation last time). And a new colleague just joined in this week :), he does seem quiet and kinda cold on the outset for one thing, but I do talk to him in some occasions and he is pretty warm in person. :) I&apos;m not really surprised that he&apos;s a Leo though. (hmm… I&apos;m starting to know horoscopes of my colleagues XDDD) And in the next few months, there&apos;ll be six more people joining our department and that&apos;s pretty something to look forward to :). And what&apos;s exciting is that my friend Kok Weng made the cut for the job :D, so we&apos;ll be colleagues in the near future :). I&apos;m really proud that he made it! :)

So that&apos;s pretty much my day :).
