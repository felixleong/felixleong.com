Finally I handed in my research assignment for the job. Phew! I was so nervous when I handed it in actually as I don&apos;t really know what to expect from my boss. And what made me even more nervous is that he skimmed through it on the spot, and I feel like I have been exposed naked in a closed room surrounded with air-conditioners capable of blowing strong, cold air at sub-zero temperatures.

Apart from some mistakes on my part, I&apos;m pretty glad that I did quite a good job, at least better than being mediocre. But of course I really don&apos;t want to speculate how much marks I would get from there.

And saying so, that pretty much signifies a beginning when my real work and responsibilities will start :). I&apos;m really looking forward to that!

Guess that&apos;s pretty much for today :).
