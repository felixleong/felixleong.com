{% mark post -%}In case anyone is wondering what happened for the past two days, I have a the worst case of illness for the years that I can remember. Probably because of a nastier flu or food poisoning. Sparing you with the gruesome details, all I can say that these two days I have been having a fever, two occasions of vomit, endless stream of diarrhoea (GOD this is hard to spell!), nasty bloating together with lots of burping, lost of appetite, having my head feeling like a helium ballon in one occassion and other minor nuisances.

Just don&apos;t ask me any sort of Nickolodeon-style "gross" questions :p.

But somehow I feel a lot better after this, physically (well… not quite, as I&apos;m still recovering from it) and emotionally. As if some burden has been thrown up and flushed into the toilet bowl. Guess I really needed that at this point of time, so thinking about it it wasn&apos;t that bad afterall.

But then again… My work is piling up in my workplace! I&apos;ll make sure that I&apos;ll do my best to finish them :). Wish me luck!{%- endmark %}
