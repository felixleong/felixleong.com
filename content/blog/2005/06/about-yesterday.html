Just a quickie about yesterday:
- Went to the bank to get one of my saving account closed (I&apos;m starting to have too much bank accounts to handle), then transfer some funds to fixed deposit. Currently I&apos;m starting my own financial plans… although it&apos;s more of an ad hoc kind of plan :p.

- Currently I&apos;m starting to notice that financial planning is definitely not easy as I found out how much that I need to pay for as expenses x_x||. Then the worse part is that I also notice how much I can&apos;t afford my own entertainment! (books, CDs and other stuff) GAH! >_<" But it&apos;s still good to have a reality check on things

- Finally I got the time to catch Madagascar! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts; :D And I really enjoyed it as I laugh so badly throughout the whole movie, not to mention that the minor references of documentary channels (read National Geographic and Animal Planet) and the use of various well known new age music (I wonder this is meant to be cheesy :p). I feel like the movie came out to be a little bit short though (but probably it&apos;s because that I digest the story way too fast :p).

And oooh~ I just love Alex the lion :D &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; Too bad he&apos;s only an animated character, but he does have all the charm and character :D

- Later when I got back home, I have a very annoying headache that I can&apos;t do anything at all! I believe it&apos;s because of the heat and I admit that I didn&apos;t drink much water though. Even though the headache&apos;s gone this morning, but I&apos;m still having that small tingling sense of pain in my head… hopefully it&apos;ll be cured soon.

That&apos;s about it. I&apos;ll be going out for some karaoke with my friends (cum colleagues) later on! I&apos;ll be updating later :)
