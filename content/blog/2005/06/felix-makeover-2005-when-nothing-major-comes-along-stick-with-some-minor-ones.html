{% mark post -%}Speaking of the 2005 makeover plans, it&apos;s been quite some time I haven&apos;t done much about it lately. Well… seeing that I&apos;m going to stick with my physical appearance for some time (well… since I can&apos;t find enough reason to spend more on these stuff as I find myself spending much less time going out lately), so I&apos;m currently spending time cleaning up my own living space and see whether it&apos;ll bring a change in lifestyle (Hmm… Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, anyone? :p)

It has been quite a chore to me actually as I find myself cleaning my own room and bathroom that hasn&apos;t been maintained well for months (or probably even a year). With all the dust, dirt, junk, fungus and other things accumulated, these few nights hasn&apos;t been easy for me as I worked very hard to get them off from the surface (Luckily I never found any skeletons in the closet :p).

For now I have cleaned up most part of my room and bathroom, and I&apos;m really proud to have a much more agreeable living area. Now all I need to do is to clear out more junk, arrange more stuff and then I will probably have more space to decorate my room a bit :). That&apos;s a really simple yet exciting prospect! :D Hmm… I&apos;m really looking forward to get an aquarium in my room some time in the future :).

As for other stuff, I have been gathering information about some financial planning stuff, which I do hope that I&apos;m able to sustain myself with the lifestyle I wanted. :) I guess it does sounds really challenging, but I&apos;m really looking forward towards the change :).

頑張ってね～{%- endmark %}
