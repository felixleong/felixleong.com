I still remembered that I got the book (Tarot In The Spirit of Zen, top right hand corner in the picture) as I first started learning the Tarot (My first book is Tarot for Dummies though :p), and I really liked the Zen&apos;s interpretation of the cards and I knew that I have to get the deck of cards. And so now I have them <3.

I personally did a few readings for myself and I do have gained a lot of insight about my own being. Guess I will be using the cards much often for daily meditation or such. ;){%- endmark %}
