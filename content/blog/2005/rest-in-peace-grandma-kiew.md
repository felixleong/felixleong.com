The bad news came this morning, Grandma Kiew has passed away this morning at around 11. It's really sad to hear that… As now the living room would be empty most of the time… She's been here ever since the first day I stayed with my aunt, and it's really hard to see her go to another place.

Rest in peace, Grandma Kiew. You'll always be remembered :(.

In a much lighter note, my SEB presents J-Euro Original Collection (Vol.1) came in today, so this will be my CD collection up until now (which I don't plan to expand for some time, probably 3 months or so):

And this my current JPop CD collection to date:

Now I really scare myself, seeing how scary my spending habits were. XD So eBay would take a cold seat for a good 3 months :)… If I have enough will power, anyway :p. But I do my best to keep this promise.
