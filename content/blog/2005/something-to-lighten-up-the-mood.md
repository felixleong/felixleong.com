SEB80 & 90 is in the mail <3333. Gotta love EMS shipping <3333~~

I'm still listening them through, but first impression wise, they are a blast! :D I'm sure they are going to make my day ^^. Now waiting for 3 items to end over eBay, and Norma Sheffield's Sweet Heaven in the mail.

Oh yeah! My digital camera finally got fixed ^^. That's pretty fast because it was repaired in one day :D. Bwee~~~ Now I want a good, tall tripod so that I can film Parapara everywhere ^^b.

You're beyond seductive, you're downright magnetic!
You life live and approach seduction on a grand scale.
You have an inner self confidence and energy that most people lack
It's these talents that make you seem extraordinary - and you truly are!</font></td></tr></table>

Umm… I don't know… self confidence… to be honest, I personally feel that my self confidence is more like a roller coaster, I just don't know when it peaks while other times gone down to the depths of the sea.
