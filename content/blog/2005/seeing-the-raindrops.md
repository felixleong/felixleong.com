Been raining quite a lot lately and that also means that I'm stuck in one.

The final year project presentation is pretty smooth, although I believe that I can do better (I always find myself making slight pauses once in a while to find suitable words on top of my brain). But overall I'm glad that I did quite well. (hopefully the grades also looks good as well).

Nothing much lately, it has been pretty calm after my final year project thesis has been handed up. Although there're some rough and rushing times, but most part of it I find myself relaxing. Does this spell a possible plan for adventure? You bet ;). I'm kinda run out of ideas though, since I'm not that much of a wild person (Ed: Define "wild" :p). Hmmmâ€¦

And speaking about my room, Johnson (another friend of mine) is currently staying over for a few days. And that means that my room is starting to get crowded :p (in a good way, of course).

Guess that's pretty much it. Going to see whether I can get my graphic card changed to something more decent (that's going to be my small-ish adventure for today).
