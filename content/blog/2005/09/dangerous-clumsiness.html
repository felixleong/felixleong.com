Trying to make a dual tone hair colour (the reason I got it bleached :p),, but it turns out that auburn is too light to make a contrast statement. But now my hair has a more natural colour now, which at least compensates for that :).

But somehow this attempt is kinda disastrous, in a way, as I accidentally stained clothing and towel (luckily those are my least favourite ones), then when I tried to rinse it, the dye got into my right eye and nose O_O|||. And gosh that burns >_<. Washed that off using a lot of water, but when I rinse my nose, the water ran through my nostrils and the water come out from my mouth (OUCH!). Everything's good now, I'm still feeling my eye and nose sore a bit now m(T^T)m.

Yeouchâ€¦ Guess I really need to be careful next time.
