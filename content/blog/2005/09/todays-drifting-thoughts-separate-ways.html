- From one point of view, being "alone" shows that you are capable to take care of yourself, that you know how to live your own life. So from that angle, it really deserves a pat on your back.

- The only depressing part is when "loneliness" kicks in. But that's an emotion that you can decide whether you'd want to dwell in for long (and I know how hard that is).

- It's really a two-person matter and getting two parties to agree upon this drastic change requires both parties to be emotionally mature. It's really not like saying "We broke up, but we can still be friends, right?" will immediately shift the mental roles in both parties.

This is what 99% of us <i>thought</i> that we have but in actual fact we don't. It's really something that <i>requires</i> training.

Just felt like keeping Ahmed's as well =3:

</em>- From 'lover' to 'friend' is such a drastic shift that our own emotions aren't ready to handle that type of transition…it can take A LOT of time =/. And having those two on your friends list is a gateway for accepting every aspect of their life, even new relationships…eventually you're gonna have to come to a point where you can just be happy for them and not feel ill-affected, and that'll take a longass time. In the long run if you have aspirations for a good relationship, time apart will be necessary, otherwise you're in for the long haul of counterproductivity.

- …if you're ready for love, be ready to exercise it off as well.

Nothing really exciting happened lately, but it's a good breeding ground for thoughts and experimentation of some of my new ideas ;). And it's been a while I haven't been doing creative writing in Chinese (and translation work, for that matter).
