Phew! I finally got round to tag all the important entries that I'm able to identify from the titles (Luckily that I have the habit to put certain keywords for special sections). I'll tag the other important entries that I've missed when I have the extra time.

As for now, I'm working on a new layout, and it'll be much cooler than before (and less plain as it is now). I'm thinking of working on a more upbeat and happier theme for it (imagine baby blue), instead of the previous deeper and probably more sombreful theme that I have used in the past (imagine darker blue hues). I think I'll work on something that can really reflect who I am now.

Anyway, for those who are interested, do check out some of my tagged posts. Those really worth mentioning are <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/felixleong/tag/drifting+thoughts">drifting thoughts</a> (all my Today's Drifting Thoughts archive), <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/felixleong/tag/poem">poems</a> (I am aware that most of them are pretty sad :( ) and <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/felixleong/tag/portfolio">portfolio</a> (contains all my artwork).

And according to the statistics, about 10% of all my posts are contributed as drifting thoughts. Hmm… Although I have to say that almost 15 of them are more contributed to my personal history though ^-^".

Other than that… I wouldn't say that things are going perfectly well, as I'm still learning how to cope with some of the deeper issues of my own. But I'll continue to do my soul searching, that's all I can say at the moment.
