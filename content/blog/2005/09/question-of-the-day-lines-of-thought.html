I just seems that the more I read self-help books, the more I find that they underlying meaning of all these books are the same: The difference found only in terms of context and expression.

However, the intrudging thought is that… Are those "truths" are timeless principles, truth, reality, natural laws or whatever you wish to call it; or are they just only my own interpretation of these expression with my own frame of reference…?
