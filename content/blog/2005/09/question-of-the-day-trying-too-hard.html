Is it that I'm trying too hard? Or is it that I have unconsciously set a impractically high standard upon myself?

And that's NOT the first time I have asked this question. It seems that I'm now having two opposing thoughts clashing with each other, and that really drains me out sometimes.

Somehow the line between my big picture of life and my own illusions/dreams has somewhat blurred to a point that I really don't know how to differentiate between them. And what's worse is that I have completely no idea what is happening that I really can't differentiate between what is the truth and what is only my own perception of things.

<b>Summary:</b> I really feel out of place -- feeling left out, in a way.
