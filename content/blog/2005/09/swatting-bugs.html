{% mark post -%}For those who wonder what happened during the weekends: Nothing much except for a very nasty programming bug that I describe it as a very resilient, agile, cunning and fast "cockroach" -- that my debugging attempt is like running around across the house, swatting it furiously with a slipper on my hand. And it seems that people (my mom, in particular) is really amused with that analogy of mine :p.

And it's really funny that my mom describes our makeshift solution is like using insect spray that is only capable to make it dizzy. Heh heh :p.{%- endmark %}
