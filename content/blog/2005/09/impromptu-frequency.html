{% mark post -%}加速的心跳，似乎在扫描着你的频率——总是希望在杂讯中寻找你的声音。

但似乎还是没法锁定好吧！因为在你身边，至今都还没跟到你的节奏。

The accelerating heartbeat, seems to scan for your frequency -- Always wishing that I'm able to find your voice from the surrounding noise.

But it seems that I'm still unable to lock it down! Because everytime being by your side, I'm still unable to follow your rhythm.{%- endmark %}
