I do agree what you are saying, sometimes we (or maybe only I myself) get so immersed in collecting and analysing data that we forgot that our main goal of doing so is to ACT and LIVE. Just collecting and analysing is only as good as building imaginary castles in the sky. (hence a "dream" but not a "goal", hmm… I think I answered my own question of the day XD)

I wonder whether that makes us mere statisticians? XDDDD

It does seems that I'm forgetting that conceptualization and idealization needs to be accompanied by manifestation and actualization. I really need to pull myself back to earth now :).

Somehow at a personal level, I'm kinda like changing course of direction for the past few months… well, as in what's really important to me that I want to put it up in LJ (as a personal record). It does seems that my recent drifting thoughts are reverting back to what I used to right during my Chapter 1 period (Jan-Nov '04).

I believe that it's time for me to discriminate a bit and focus my energies on my future plans that I have been manifesting.

… And by that, I believe I can expect myself running into walls XDDD *hearing bumping and crashing noises*{%- endmark %}
