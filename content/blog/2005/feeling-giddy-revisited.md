Staying at home the whole day today, reading up materials for my project stuff.

Now I'm feeling really light-headed, probably due to the fact that I have been reading on my bed while lying down, and dozing off off and on.

Don't really feel like writing much now, I'm not really feeling well today, both physically and emotionally. Mehâ€¦ -\_-"

Snagged this quiz from Ahmed, but be forewarned though, **this quiz might disturb you:**

Take the quiz: <a href="http://www.zenhex.com/quiz.php?id=1744">"What do you love about making love?"<br /><img src="http://www.zenhex.com/quiz/1744/res6.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><b>Intimacy</b><br />You love to be intimate with someone. You know every inch of them, you're big on touching and any kind of body contact especially cuddling though you need to feel comfortable with someone.
