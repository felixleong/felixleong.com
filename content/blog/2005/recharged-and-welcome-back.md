Just went back to my parents' place during the weekend, although I was expecting some relaxation, but in the end it turns out to be quite the opposite as I find myself going out places to meet up with some of my high school friends :). But it has been good times.

Well… honestly I wouldn't say everything is great for me as I just feel that everything back here has changed… it wasn't the same feeling anymore when I talked to some friends. But my sister said something that really put things into perspective "… Or is it I'm the one who has changed?". Hmm…

Coming back, we celebrated Father's Day yesterday by having dinner at a nice restaurant. Originally I was the one who is supposed to treat my dad, but in the end it's the reverse as my dad wanted to celebrate for me getting good results on the final semester. :)

And now I'm back in my office, coming back into the position which I'm responsible of :). I'm sure there's more challenges ahead of me this time round.

Oh yeah! I dyed my hair black yesterday with the help of my sister. I really liked it and I have been having the "Welcome back" feeling. Well… probably because I did said to myself that I'll get my hair back to black  when I have found myself… I don't know, somehow it does seems that I have the tendency to put symbolic meanings to the things around me. But I'll definitely dye my hair again when I feel like it, now it's much more of a personal image thingy than anything seriously important/symbolic. :)

That's pretty much it!
