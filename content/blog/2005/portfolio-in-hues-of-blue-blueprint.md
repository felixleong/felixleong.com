Here's a blueprint of the final LJ layout:

The colors are **painstakingly** hard to pick, as it's really hard to create some warmth with **blue** alone. But luckily some white, teal and indigo (?) and toned-down contrast helped to ignite the warmth in the design. I didn't use much pictures though :/, I wonder whether this will make it too flat since there aren't much texture in it. (Or should I think positive and call it *minimalistic?* XD) Studying the HTML structure of my layout does make it look easy for me to apply this as soon as possible :).

As for my day, I'm still hovering with the thoughts yesterday, still trying to reposition myself somewhat… Well… at least this is much more easier than the CODS (Crush Over-Dwelling (Dependent? :p) Syndrome) I'm not that emotionally driven that I can't concentrate on any work at all.

[:: Update @ 11:30pm ::]

This is the actual HTML and CSS implementation of it:

I have to cut some design elements away, but overall I'm happy with it. I'll get the layout up by Tuesday :).
