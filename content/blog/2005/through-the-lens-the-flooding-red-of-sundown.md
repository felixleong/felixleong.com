Well… Probably I don't think I'll keep up with the photo entrée concept at the point of time due to several reason, so I think I might add another category to fill in those scenes that I really liked when I manage to grab my camera ;).

Anyway, these are taken yesterday and it's one of the rare occasions that the sundown covers the whole city in reddish hues, and I really find it lovely (well… although it DID gave me the creeps at the same time, no thanks to fiction XDDD). I was still feeling weak at the moment so these photographs are taken from places near my bed (I do wished that I can walk outside though).

*"As if I saw the dying moments of the Phoenix, burning herself into ashes while darkness looms the earth momentarily… and She will rise again will a welcoming blue glow of light."*

*"Opening the windows, and I only realized that how many false filters have been cheating me all this while that there can only be blue outside."*

That pretty much sums up the recall of my own thoughts when I took these pictures :).
