title: My iPod (and Ears) Are Choking!

Maybe it isn't a great idea to visit the music store again, because I always have the tendency to check out stuff in the budget corner :p. (and ending up buying stuff if I saw some gems lying around)

And so I did bought stuff XD.

Everything begins when I notice Lene's Play With Me CD in the budget corner, and considering that I remembered seeing it being mentioned in koneko4serious's LJ, I was tempted to pick that up. And the first thing I notice is that Lene is the vocalist of AQUA! And so I just grabbed it without much thought :p.

Other than that, I also grabbed Nu Virgo's Stop! Stop! Stop! (which DOES look Eurodance to me, LOL :p) and Lisa Maffia's First Lady (I got it only because I have to buy 2 CDs for the cheapest price and the selection really looks like it should be in the bargain bin :p).

And now I just feel as if I would need some time to digest all the music I had bought :p.
