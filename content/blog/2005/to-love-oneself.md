It's been about a week ever since my modem fried, and having myself being less exposed to the Internet at the same time. Apart from checking my e-mail, catching up with the latest happenings of the online forums that I frequent and updating my LJ, most of my time spent is more on â€¦mmm, living my life XDDD.

OK, maybe more than that.

These days I have been thinking, a lot in fact, reviewing quite a lot of my own perspective towards a lot of different things. It's kind of interesting actually, I just feel like I'm putting myself on a third person perspective while looking into my thoughts during the past and present.

I believe what I have put on the title have summed up the thoughts that I have put into, as I don't think I'm able to recall the whole process of coming to this three words.

In other news, another project presentation tommorrow, and I finally get to try Parapara Paradise v1.1, and gosh the arrows are really slow (almost half a beat off, it seems). But still the version 1 variants is still my favourite of the whole arcade series :D. (apart from the fact that it has less songs, but then again, I would prefer doing it outside the machine anyway :))

Guess that's it.
