For those who are figuring of why the lack of updates, basically I'm OK. Just that the recent thunderstorms and the heavy downpour is extremely scary, and my main phone line got snapped and no phone + Internet for the past few days.

But everything is OK now, but probably I should go out and shop for a 56K modem since I can't be borrowing Theen Gee's notebook everytime I wanted to surf around.

Exam officially started yesterday, with virtual reality to kickstart everything. I'll be taking three subjects, Virtual Reality is done with, Combinatronics tommorrow and Parallel Processing a week later. For the Virtual Reality paper, I believe I did pretty well, despite the fact that my hands ache after the whole 2 hours and I didn't manage to complete the whole paper. But things are pretty good and I believe that I answered them considerably well.

I'm a little bit nervous about tommorrow though, since Combinatronics has to be my weakest link. But I'm going to do more tutorials just to make sure that I have enough exposure to different types of problems.

Gotta go now!
