I think I'm running out of brain juice to elaborate my thoughts to a complete drifting thought post, so I came up with a new title instead. Wellâ€¦ this is mainly due to the fact that I believe that I have a lot of ideas and thoughts that I want to further develop and yet I forget after letting it slip through after a certain period of time.

So the question for today is: How do we define as being overly critical to oneself? More often than not, some of us would probably experience times when we feel inferior at some point of life that we react (or respond, depending on one's perception) in some way or the other. And one of these reaction/responses is to be critical to oneself. And as much as it serves a good motivation factor, being overly critical to oneself would have demotivate a person, causing avoidance in a person, or probably even depression. So what can one do to overcome it?

This will be some food for thought for all of us ;).
