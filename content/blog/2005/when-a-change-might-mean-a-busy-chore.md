Theen Gee left this morning as I was still asleep, he left a note hoping me to take care of myself. It's been two months having a room mate and his departure does make me kinda lonely this morning.

But today I just took the initiative to clean up the room, as I do notice that my own room is a total disaster. Probably some things are more noticeable when the absence of some things. And so I almost spent the whole day rearranging my stuff, sweeping away the piling dusts, give the floor the finishing mop as well as clearing away some of the junk that I have kept all this while. It now looks much more cleaner right now :). At least it's much more agreeable now (as in, for a person to live in :p):

Now I'm planning to clean my room and bathroom in several phases, hope I'll be having a squeaky clean room to sleep in :).

The books are arranged, and I OUGHT to buy a new book rack :p

On an unrelated note, I have been having some… umm, dreams… >.> <.< I don't use to have them, probably once or twice in a year or so, but in these days they come in such frequency that this week alone I have been having them for like 3-4 times already (Lucky that I didn't make a mess out of it). I wonder…

Anyway, will be catching Mr & Mrs Smith tomorrow with Jacob, and I'll be donating blood as well somewhere nearby :). I would really love to watch Madagascar though :(, but I think I'll go watch it alone some time later… probably next week?
