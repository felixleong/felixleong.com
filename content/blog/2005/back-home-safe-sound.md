Just arrived home :). Gave a few shocks to my family members, but it's really great to be back at home. It's really fun actually, being able to talk with my family on a lot of things.

Of course… they do care about me in terms of relationship stuff. And… honestly speaking, it's still a bit heartaching… but their intentions are good, so it's pretty much OK.

Anyway, be meeting up my friends tommorrow at my highschool. Preparing for more shocks ;P.
