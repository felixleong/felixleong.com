It does seems that I have been pondering a lot during the past few days (which is obviously noticable with the number of drifting thought entries that I have posted), and some really interesting points seems to surface out from these.

And what interest me more is the comments that is posted in these entries, as I found out that little nuggets of knowledge and wisdom is being found from the active process of thinking and communicating our thoughts relating to certain issues. And that's really a rewarding experience for all of us :).

OKâ€¦ where have I drifted myself to :p. Anyway, just wanted to say that do check out the comments in my previous entries as there is some really good comments from people and I have extended some of my entries by further exploring these drifting thoughts through these comments.

Hope it'd be some help :).
