What a busy day today, been doing a lot of work to make sure that my sister will be on her way safely to home. It's pretty sudden that she has to go home because tomorrow's a really important day for her, as she will be receiving her results for her STPM. Basically STPM is a government exam for pre-university students (we call it Form 6 over here, and technically it should still be considered as high school :p) and this certification examination is the one of the most important evaluation examinations in entering local universities. Hopefully she does good in it ^^.

Just on my way home, somewhat the thoughts of ACen seems to got me into daydreaming. Somehow I just so feel like going overseas for a holiday :). Somehow it's going to be cool to go to the states and meet up some of my friends whom I knew online. That's really going to be fun <333 Hmm… somehow it's not that my daydreams weren't without any worries though, it's kinda of scary to think of getting a passport, dealing with officials in the airport, thinking of what to pack and what not to, dealing with American accents and culture (well… as much as I'm confident with my English skills and I have no problem catching up with English on TV, but I'm more worried of the other way round when people might have a tough time understanding my Asian accent XD)…

Not to mention that it does cost **a-lot-of-$$$** :p, and not to mention that probably the main highlight of going to the states is to go to ACen to para, which might not worth the expensive air fare (from one point of view)… but still that thought really excites me to go there ;). Anxiety aside, probably I'm planning to go there, once I'm sure of getting the job and manage to get my financial planning right. Hopefully I can make it next year ^^. But then again, thinking of those teeny-weeny stuff, it's kinda scary since it's the first time I will go overseas, not to mention without any company as well (read: going alone XD).

Hmmm… that's just one wish that I would love to fulfill in the future ^^. *makes mental note*

Anyway, ClubJapan has charged my card ^^. Not too sure how much they charged, but I believe I can only check my statement online tomorrow. And in other news, my final year project dues this week, and I'm doing some finishing touches to my system, and hopefully I can work the thesis out within a day or two. Must make sure everything is done perfectly :). Guess that's it!

[edit: Oh god… I'm getting the fuzzy feeling towards someone again (translation: I'm getting the crush). And it's really someone unexpected since that person DID annoyed me like hell once :p. I don't know, still analysing my own feelings and thoughts ;).]
