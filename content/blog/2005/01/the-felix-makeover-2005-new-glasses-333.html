ハンサムでしょう？ :p

Bwee~ Just got my new specs. :) Honestly speaking when I first got it this morning and tried it, I didn&apos;t really liked it at first though :p. Probably the feeling I had yesterday has carried forward, I guess. But after a while when my mood picked up later, I found myself looking in the mirror once too many. :p

I suppose what makes you feel good and *ahem* handsome is perhaps a great mood ;). Ah~ I just love that feeling of confidence. Of course, knowing what kind of mood I&apos;m having yesterday and what I felt, I suppose I need to keep that attitude myself :).

On a personal note, well… probably I&apos;m still clinging on to what I&apos;m not able to own (well, you know what I mean)… which somewhat does drag my mood down once in a while… But I know I&apos;ll still keep on trying, and at the same time I do need to learn how to open my eyes a bit and explore new possibilities.

Ah~~!!! I guess I better don&apos;t spoil this excitement I&apos;m having now! :) Here&apos;s more pictures~~~ <333
