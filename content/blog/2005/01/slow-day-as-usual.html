Just sitting around here while I&apos;m waiting for the videos to get uploaded so that Nine can edit them. And since it&apos;s like 100MBs or so with an upload speed of 11KBps isn&apos;t exactly all that funny, but at least it&apos;s better than doing it on dialup X(. Gah I do need QuickTime Pro X(!

Feeling a bit light-headed today for some unknown reasons, I really wonder why this is happening though. It&apos;s like I&apos;m on alcohol or drugs or something but in actual fact I really hate them. Hmmâ€¦ Probably I&apos;m a bit sensitive or something (or am I?) :p

Other than that guess I really need to work out my stuff later on.
