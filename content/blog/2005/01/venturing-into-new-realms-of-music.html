Let see… loan money in my bank, about time X(. Anyway, plan to bank in more than half of it to my parents for being so supportive all the while ^^, umm… or should I say that I have to return my college money back to them? :p

Anyway, bought some new CDs today, and I can say that I&apos;m currently venturing into other music genre. Well… currently listening to Biggest Club Hits… Ever!, which contains quite a lot of various different dance genres: House, electronica, club, techno etc. Well… techno STILL grates my ears, but House tunes are kinda fun to listen to. Hmmm~ :)

Other than that, I got The Music of Enya by The Taliesin Orchestra. Finally I get my hands on New Age. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll be liking it ^^.

OK, almost time for me to get off now.
