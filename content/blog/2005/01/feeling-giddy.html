{% mark post -%}Learnt a new word today when I browse through the LJ mood list:

<b>Giddy [adj]</b>
1. Having or causing a whirling sensation; liable to falling
2. Lacking seriousness; given to frivolity

The first one would definitely fit what I&apos;m feeling right now, because it seems that I didn&apos;t get a good nap as well as the electrical surges are making the lights flicker. Ouch… >.<

Anyway, duh… dizziness… @_@…

Just some sidenotes… as much as I really liked my new look, somewhat all of a sudden I just feels that it didn&apos;t suit me. Well… It&apos;s not that I don&apos;t like it, in fact I really love the look because I really like the fact that it shows out my confident self. Just that I really don&apos;t know what happened which triggers this feeling… But what I do know is that… somewhat I&apos;m feeling a bit down… ah, nevermind… been really missing my crushes desparately ;___;. [:: edit :: Looking at it a few minutes later, I guess I&apos;m just being a little bit emotional, that&apos;s all. ;)]

Anyway, I think Bean is coming over later… Honestly I don&apos;t know what to respond to this… because many thoughts and memories seems to flood back to me…

Getting my glasses tommorrow, by the way. Will snap photos ;).

[p/s: Will post my April 2004 review when I&apos;m feeling better. Bleargh…]{%- endmark %}
