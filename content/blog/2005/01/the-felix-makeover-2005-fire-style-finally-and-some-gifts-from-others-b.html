Honestly I&apos;m totally beat when I&apos;m on my way home, but Erika asked me out since she said that she won&apos;t be free tomorrow to shop for my clothes. And so I went out. Honestly speaking my mood isn&apos;t really good, still feeling heavy because of the CODS but I went anyway. But it turns out to be much more of an awkward situation because I kept my silence for the first half of the shopping trip. But I&apos;m glad she took me out in the first place because I do have fun after this ^^.

But luckily the pants in Soda&apos;s bargain bin seems to catch my eye and it only took me 30 minutes or so to complete my Fire style for Chinese New Year ^^b. But honestly speaking, thinking back of the description of my ideal concept for Fire and Ice style, somewhat it just seems that my Ice style seems to have a much more drastic change than what I had for Fire XDDD. But nonetheless I got two contrasting sets of clothes which looks extremely cool on me ^^. Anyway, the list for my Fire style:
- Soda&apos;s black pants [RM49]. I love the fabric <333, but I really don&apos;t know what it is made of since the label didn&apos;t mention anything about it. It&apos;s really comfy to wear, the cuttings are pretty much simplistic (or should I say that there&apos;s nothing fancy about it), but I really love the pants <33.
- Soda&apos;s umm… blouse? XDDD [RM55.20]. No kidding, that&apos;s what it wrote on the my receipt for the red shirt XD. Ah~ anyway :p.
- White belt from Tropicana Life [RM27]. Well… since I didn&apos;t own a white belt XD. But it looked pretty cool, as much it was pretty much hidden

So here&apos;s a picture of it:

And oh yeah! I promised that I&apos;ll take a photo of Erika&apos;s birthday present to me and this is how the outfit looks like:

OK, I&apos;m feeling a bit tired right now and I&apos;m a bit sleepy, so do excuse me for a while *yawn*. Enjoy the rest of the photos (and more to come tomorrow!)

One of my friends represented our University to participate in a competition (Basketball, I believe) in Indonesia and she gave me a really cool pen as a souvenir <333
