I can&apos;t remember the last time I ever wore a necklace. I still remembered that when I was seven, my mom get me to wear a necklace with a pendant, engraved with a meditating Buddha. And I still remember that after quite some time of wearing it, I believe I swore that I&apos;ll never have any sort of accessory on my body except for my trusty watch.

And now, after about two decades of not having anything dangling on any of my body parts (apart from the watch, of course), I just decided to break from that vow and wore the necklace I bought yesterday. Anyway, for the first time, I did felt some weight on my neck after a while, as much as the pendant is extremely light. Guess it does take some time getting used to it.

Just as a sidenote, Steven did ask me why an image change all of a sudden, not to mention that I&apos;m opting for a teenager style instead of a matured one (well… seeing that I&apos;ll be graduating and starting to be out there working)… Hmm, I don&apos;t know :p, but I do know that I haven&apos;t been acting my age all the while. XD Seriously speaking… I don&apos;t know why I would want to change my image actually, honestly speaking I&apos;m not changing my image for the sake of others or some sort of motives… or perhaps I should say that I have no idea why I would want it in the first place XD. But probably it&apos;s because that I really like it, from the day after I got myself the haircut. :) Guess that&apos;s all to it, I guess.

Anyway, signing off now ^^.

[p/s: Here&apos;s a picture of the pendant:]
