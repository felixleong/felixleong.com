{% mark post -%}<b>June 2004 -- Walking Proud</b>
<i>"… because it&apos;s seems easy for us to say that it&apos;s OK to be alone and love is optional, but desire always arise to disprove that statement." -- June 6, 2004</i>

Main Events:
- Befriended Choon Hui
- … which, in turn, found my own true love (albiet one-sided). Well, at least the person whom I love the most
- Starts to coin the term CODS: Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome XDDD.
- Starting to translating a hell of of stuff from Chinese to English, and currently became one of my hobbies :p
- Completed my PPP video series (at least the numbered ones =3)
- Quoting myself: "Idiot Homework Sellers Making Advertisement Publicly". I REALLY hope this is only a prank

Comment:
June has to be the coolest month in 2004 ^^. Well… honestly speaking this person Choon Hui has pretty much mentioned in almost every single entry in June XDDD. And personally I&apos;m not surprised :3.

Pretty much indirectly, June signifies a turning point in my own life: the start of an end to my own depression, gained back what I believe is lost: my confidence, focus and goals in life… I guess for those who has been following my LJ ever since last June would have known how important Choon Hui is to me: Not only he the perfect person I seek, getting to befriend him have definitely changed my life ever since.

Thinking back, I can still recall all those precious moments with him vividly: the laughter, joy, disappointments and embarrassments. As much as I knew I would never stand a chance to be with him… and probably will never be, he&apos;ll still be the most important friend I would ever had in my whole life. In my heart, and just being his friend is the proudest thing I ever had. Given the chance, I would love to let him know about this personally :3.

Currently I&apos;m still adjusting myself… letting this love go and try to approach him as a great friend. To be frank, I do have my own doubts, knowing that it&apos;d be really hard… and painful to let it go totally, but I believe… that this will be the best for him… and probably for myself as well.

Anyway, I would really like to dedicate Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s walking proud to him now, as much I know he isn&apos;t into JPop.　(Probably Ayu&apos;s Moments and Carols as well)

"Konna koe wa, todokimasu ka
 Kimi no mune e, hibikimasu ka
 Kimi no se o ikiru michi shiru be ni
 Kyou mo aruitemasu"

Will this voice reach you
And resonates in your heart?
I&apos;ll always let your stature be my life direction
And continue to walk my path today
