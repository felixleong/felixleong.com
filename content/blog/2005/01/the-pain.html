<hr />
No matter how hard I tried, I can&apos;t seem to bear the pain deep inside. The tears which has been contained seem to have a leak somewhere that it flows down uncontrollably.

… Do I deserve all this pain? Now I really don&apos;t know whether they are caused by others or by myself…

… I wish I knew the answer…
