For some reasons I was thinking of picking Mahjong back again (not the solitaire type, but the real, traditional three to four players kind). I still remembered that I used to have quite a lot of fun with a freeware (open source, to be accurate) Mahjong game but I can&apos;t seem to find it from my backup files.

Later on it took me quite a long time to search through Google (since the solitaire type have pretty much flooded the search results) and a few really good webpages to find the exact link. For those who are interested, do check Julian Bradfield&apos;s <a href="http://www.stevens-bradfield.com/MahJong/">Mah-Jong For Unix (and Windows)</a>.

Still half way downloading it, probably I&apos;m able to have my brains working in no time ;).
