2nd day of class: met more of my old friends, got more comments on my new hairdo, being in the same class with the people I loved -- what can I expect more? :)

Seeing them really makes me really happy, and it was quite a heart throbbing experience to see their existence :). I don&apos;t know… probably we might not get to meet in the future… which is something that I&apos;m afraid of. But I&apos;m just glad to see them around and to be by their side for a slight moment ;).

Currently trying to get Linux into my system, it didn&apos;t go as smoothly as I thought, but I&apos;m trying to iron things out a little. I&apos;m lucky to have my iPod to double as my external hard drive right now. ^^ Hopefully everything can be done soon enough ;).

Oh yeah, I messed up this time round and I notice that I&apos;ll only get my glasses on Thursday. ^^" But I have classes in the afternoon, so I really hope that I&apos;m able to pick up my glasses in the morning instead. Maybe I&apos;ll just call them up on that day itself. I&apos;m really excited with the next step of getting a new look ^^.
