{% mark post -%}Nothing special happened today, but I&apos;m feeling extremely down today. I&apos;m not going to go into details here, due to the fact that:
1. It can be extremely ugly
2. Probably no one wants to read them
3. I&apos;m feeling better right now and I can&apos;t recapture the same feeling again

If anyone is interested, Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s GAME pretty much sums up every single thing that reflects on my current situation and feelings. [*p/s: Read up the lyrics]

…

Anyway, on a lighter note, just strolling around the park in the municipal office today, and I just found two spots which I would really love to film my para at :3, cause the location looks extremely gorgeous. Just that I&apos;m wondering whether I would need any permission to do so. And probably I would also need a good tripod and a friend to look after my things. Hmm…

And so here&apos;s my next batch of photographs I took:

I&apos;m starting my Fruit Basket manga collection <333 (As much I&apos;m still learning Japanese and I can&apos;t make up almost 80% of the dialogue without any translation help)

Just for the fun of it, a shot of myself while I&apos;m studying for my final year project.
