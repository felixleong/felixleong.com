Yeah! New year 2005! :D

Anyway, just to recap what happened yesterday, I went out with Johnson at around 8 something and pretty much went there to get some rechargable batteries and a nifty new toy for my iPod:

Bwee~ the Phillips BA109 portable stereo which runs on batteries :D, not to mention it&apos;s the cheapest offer that I can get (hey~ for RM70, I&apos;m extremely happy with it). So that means that I can now officially say that now I can bring my music and do the parapara wherever I please, only limited to battery life and strict people/places :). The sound quality sounds is not that power-packed, but then again, for a budget set of speakers, it&apos;s definitely a good buy. Not to mention it runs on batteries~~~ *echos~~~* Now all I need is perhaps a bag or something to contain all my gadgets in~

Whatelse… I&apos;m still hesitating whether I would want to have a small aquarium in my room :3. For some reasons I would really love to rear some fishies in my room ^^. Anyway~ Let me see whether I have some leftover cash for them.

One funny thing that occur to me is that apparently I learnt Boogie Boogie (AJC) in 10 MINUTES O_O". Well… looking at it, Ahmed&apos;s routines weren&apos;t all that technical, but then usually it&apos;d have took me at least half an hour to learn a new para. But somehow I just feel that song is really meant for me somehow :3. Maybe I will refilm that :D.

Will be going out to the movies with Steven, Erika, Rachael and Soo Hoo later, heard that they are watching "Meet The Fockers" today. Hmm~ Anyway, better enjoy my new year ^^.
