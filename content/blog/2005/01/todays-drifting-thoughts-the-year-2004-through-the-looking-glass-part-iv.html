Main Events:
- Caught up with orange juice addiction (which pretty much means that I&apos;m addicted to anything citrus :p)
- Nine/Phil/Nine… whatever XDD became my PPS friend, and still will be the most enjoyable Internet friend I had (well… as much as I would say that we didn&apos;t talk much, but I really enjoyed his stuff :3)
- Become much more active in Parapara: in terms of dance performance… umm, practice would be a better word :p, and choreography :)
- Completed MYPPF -The Animation- and the response is a blast! :D
- Have my first taste of online relationships… but apparently it didn&apos;t work out
- Handled my first ever forum flamewar (and god that wasn&apos;t funny)

- Interviewed for a job offer as a sprite artist for a local game company (which I got rejected later on :p)
- Chi/Seraphic Law/drifting_floe went into a sudden haitus. Probably won&apos;t be seeing him again :(

WOA! Honestly speaking April is the one of the most happening months I had in 2004! :D (Even the main event list is longer than what I had expected).

Somewhat it&apos;s just funny to see my own words becoming self-prophecies. On April 9, I wrote <i>"At this point, I have a nasty sense that some drama in my life is starting to unfold…"</i>, guess I&apos;m pretty right on that one, and apparently looking at it, it really an experience to me in many ways: from being a failure, to having great achievements, to having a emotional roller coaster ride… As much as I feel tired at times, but I&apos;m really glad to have these experiences, it does gave me a chance to see that there&apos;s much more things in life to do.

Then in April, I did notice that I brought up the insecurity issues quite a lot actually. Been thinking a lot of about the security issue, my personal identity, and probably my own relationship concept, and really I believe that I really raised quite a lot of good questions for myself to answer (Refer to the longer posts that I have posted up). During that time, my online life is much much more vibrant that it is in my real life actually. I wonder whether is this escapism? Hmm… But then nowadays I do miss chatting with some of my online pals (but then again, I personally can&apos;t find much topics that I can chat about ^^")

All in all, April is pretty much a really dynamic and dramatic month for me :). It&apos;s fun to surf on the danger waves of life, but this time round I think I better be more prepared before hitting the waves again :p.
