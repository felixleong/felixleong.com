OK, just to say that I&apos;m still alive, but my dialup Internet credits has been used up so that I won&apos;t be able to be online these few days. Still prodding my bank to get my Internet bill settled :&apos;-(.

Anyway, quite a few major events happening. Just to make things short, I&apos;m having the CODS during the past few days, which is pretty aching :&apos;-(. Then on Saturday, I went to Genting to participate the Programming Competition Presentation Night and Prize Giving Ceremony and I won :D. Bwee~ I got the consolation prize (Merit) ^^. Well, I&apos;m not the only one getting the prize, Choon Hui also gets the consolation prize (Distinction) as well ^^. So yeah I&apos;m really proud.

Then on Sunday I&apos;ve been joining Grace&apos;s party and it&apos;s pretty fun with tons of laughs. It&apos;s really a fun Sunday indeed.

As for today, I&apos;m still having the CODS blues now :&apos;(. Well… still learning how to cope with it actually. I&apos;ll read through the Friends pages when I had the time. I believe catching up 4 days worth of LJ friends entries is… uh… overwhelming.

Felix siging off now. (and hopefully my Internet is back by tonight)

[:: UPDATE ::]
- Yes my account is loaded so I&apos;m able to be back online in no time ^^.
- Tons of new photos with me, will be posting them up later ^^b
- Yeah reading friends entries does lighten my mood ^^
