嫌いんです！今のお天気がとても悪いだって、僕の全身は湿りました。
(I really hate this! The weather now is extremely bad now, that my whole body is getting wet.) << I don&apos;t think my translation is correct, but then again, I&apos;m much more unsure whether my Japanese I correct either :p. Anyone kind enough to help?

[p/s: should the use of から　(because) would be better here?]

Anyway, just for some reasons today is extremely happening. During the afternoon at class, there&apos;s an extremely bad electrical breakdown in town which lasted about an hour or two, then later on it rained extremely badly on my way home just now >.<".

Other than that, things are pretty good, except that I&apos;m feeling a bit wet now.

Anyway, Guess who is having his birthday today? :3 HAPPY BIRTHDAY PHIL (aka Phil) :D!!! Hope you&apos;ll get to see more Domino in SEB in your big 2-O&apos;s. :D

OK, back to work now!

HOT DAMN! I didn&apos;t notice that <a href="http://www.paraparastage.com/">PPStage</a> is already up with the stuff… well, at least the videos section XD (Under Working Material > Visual Mixes > Paralist Routines). It did have some of my videos up there, so do check them out if you haven&apos;t ^^. Probably would submit a few of my better original routines to P-chan later on ^^.
