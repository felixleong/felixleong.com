Staying at home the whole day today, reading up materials for my project stuff.

Now I&apos;m feeling really light-headed, probably due to the fact that I have been reading on my bed while lying down, and dozing off off and on.

Don&apos;t really feel like writing much now, I&apos;m not really feeling well today, both physically and emotionally. Mehâ€¦ -_-"

Snagged this quiz from Ahmed, but be forewarned though, <b>this quiz might disturb you</b>:

Take the quiz: <a href="http://www.zenhex.com/quiz.php?id=1744">"What do you love about making love?"<br /><img src="http://www.zenhex.com/quiz/1744/res6.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><b>Intimacy</b><br />You love to be intimate with someone. You know every inch of them, you&apos;re big on touching and any kind of body contact especially cuddling though you need to feel comfortable with someone.
