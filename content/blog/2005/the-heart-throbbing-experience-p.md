2nd day of class: met more of my old friends, got more comments on my new hairdo, being in the same class with the people I loved -- what can I expect more? :)

Seeing them really makes me really happy, and it was quite a heart throbbing experience to see their existence :). I don't know… probably we might not get to meet in the future… which is something that I'm afraid of. But I'm just glad to see them around and to be by their side for a slight moment ;).

Currently trying to get Linux into my system, it didn't go as smoothly as I thought, but I'm trying to iron things out a little. I'm lucky to have my iPod to double as my external hard drive right now. ^^ Hopefully everything can be done soon enough ;).

Oh yeah, I messed up this time round and I notice that I'll only get my glasses on Thursday. ^^" But I have classes in the afternoon, so I really hope that I'm able to pick up my glasses in the morning instead. Maybe I'll just call them up on that day itself. I'm really excited with the next step of getting a new look ^^.
