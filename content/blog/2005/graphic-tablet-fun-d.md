Yay! Got the tablet running in both Windows and Linux! :D

Now I'm having fun just do some random scribbles and experimenting how to make realistic digital paint effects :).

Randomly scribbled this:

And just thinking of having more organic lines to my artwork and web page designs are really making me excited! :D

In other news, going to Port Dickson tomorrow! :D
