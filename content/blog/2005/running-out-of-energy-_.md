title: Running Out of Energy ._.

I feel so physically drained out yesterday that I feel as if I'm living with my last ounce of energy x\_x. Probably I either have been working out too much (currently stays with my daily para practice and aerobic classes), or that I didn't have enough sleep (I can safely conclude that I need 7 or 8) or that my daily lifestyle needs some more tweaking.

Feeling much more refreshed today as I slept very early yesterday almost right after I reached home after work and woke up VERY late this morning (at 7 actually, but it's an hour and a half before my working hours O\_O").

Probably I would need to do some adjustments in my own lifestyle and probably it would take me a few weeks to get things right. But definitely I'm looking forward to that :). (at least I don't have to worry too much about my physical well being)
