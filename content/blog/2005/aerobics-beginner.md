Phew! Just came back from my first class in aerobics. And phew it's really intense and it does work the whole body out! *Feel muscle strains* But it's really fun :), probably not as fun as para, but it's kinda interesting to learn out the steps and everything :D.

The teacher commented that I'm a fast learner in this, which is quite a complement to me :). Probably having some sense of rhythm and para practice does help a lot in this? Heh heh :p

I'm looking forward to the next class! Hope it's going to be more fun. (Hopefully the intensity doesn't go far beyond my reach, but that's a good challenge to me :))
