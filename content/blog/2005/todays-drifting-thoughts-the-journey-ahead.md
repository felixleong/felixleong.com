From time-to-time,  
I couldn't stop looking back  
from where I have been

With awe,  
I see the path  
on which I have travelled

Looking forward,  
I see the path ahead  
With awe,  
I see vastness

And then,  
With hesitation,  
My body goes a-trembling…

…

That pretty much how I feel now… I can't really finish or polish it just yet as I really have no idea what is going to be ahead on me. (and it's been a while since I last write poems and stuff, meh…)

Guess I might as well resume with my own plans and work.
