YES! The phone line is finally fixed (thanks to my aunt for that :D)!

Anyway, just a recap of stuff:

### About work:

Things are starting to get busy now as we are starting the development for the new release of the system. Somehow the more I looked at the schedule, the more I'm impressed by my boss. It's really hard to say, since I don't really get to talk to him much, but I just feel as if he always have those big plans under his sleeves which maximises the potential of all the resources that he had. Definitely somebody that I can learn a lot from :).

### About home town and family

My parents are great as usual :D, although without the presence of my siblings does make the house seems quiet at times. My parents are still very concerned about my sister who already went to Sabah, which is considered very far from the peninsular. But it does seems that my sister is adapting to her new environment. Hope she has a good time in university :).

### About sickness

One of the least enjoyable things back home is that I'm not feeling very well physically as I find myself catching a cold. So tissues are almost scattered everywhere :(. And what makes it worse is the body heat ("heatiness" in Chinese medicinal terms) and sore throat! Blegh~ That's not fun. At least things are getting better now, but I'm still wasting my tissue supply :(

Now the second thing that really irks me is my lack of energy and some minor physical, muscle aches… Didn't really like being lethargic all the time.

### About comics

Being at home, I have been spending time rereading Tsubasa -Reservoir Chronicles- and xxxHolic (CLAMP goodness~) I still remembered that when I first read Tsubasa, I'm really confused with the storyline, but as I reread the whole thing again together with xxxHolic, I'm really starting to understand the storyline. And woah, xxxHolic gave me a lot of room for deep thoughts…

### About thoughts

It's been a while I have really get myself into pondering things lately. Hmm… probably there weren't much new things that excite my brain? Or is it that I'm already executing my own plans and see what new questions that will arise from there? But recently I have been spending more time reflecting on myself: about changes in my own life, values, goals and ambitions. I think I'll elaborate on that when I had the time.

###About dancing

I'm loving my Friday's aerobics class :D! Currently I'm thinking of picking up ballroom and social dancing as well *^_^*. A partner to learn together with would definitely be great, but for the time being I think I'll be picking up some basics myself first to see whether I find interest in it or not. Still finding inspiration for choreographing new paras, especially after I find myself loving some great Euromach tracks! :D

### About Bon Odori's photographs

Just as promised ;) :

The third person from the right is Sook Lan's husband :), followed by Eng Lee and his girlfriend. Just a sidenote, Eng Lee joined on the same day as I do :).

I think that should cover all… :)
