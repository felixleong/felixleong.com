Just had Korean food just now, and I really loved it ^^b. I had one of those BBQ lambchop thingy (well… I don't know how is it called in Korean ^^") and it's really tasty ^^. Not to mention that the service staff is extremely friendly <333. I think I would try more Korean food next time ^^b.

Other than that, I just bought MISIA's 星空のライヴ -The Best of Acoustic Ballade- and I just love it instantly~~

That's pretty much it for today ^^.
