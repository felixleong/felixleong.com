Somehow this song just grow in me after several runs of SEB75 and Aerobeat Eurobeat Version 4. Listening it through I do have a love-hate relationship with this song, because it really sounds… cruel.

Personally I find this to remind of a particular relationship I had in the past… thinking about it, it seems that it's more of a song for people to dedicate to myself ^^".

## Why Can't This Be Love / Drama

Why don't you believe  
I say why you don't believe that I love you  
After all I have to pretend to know whatever you've got in  
And I really wonder  
Why I should achieve  
I say why I should achieve what I run to  
After that you got me started so fast  
Nobody can't stop the race now  
And I do wonder wonder  

\* If you really want to restart the game with me  
And explanation of situation is over  
You and me

\*\* Why can't this be love and tell me  
Why can't we go on together  
Why can't this be called affection  
Why you keep on tellin' me lies

Why can't this be love  
I say why can't this be love and affection  
Since you know what happened there on the beach  
Was more and more than a feeling  
And I do wonder wonder

(Repeat \*)
(Repeat \*\*)

Damn… Why I kept on flooding my LJ with lyrics XD?

Anyway, still can't sleep as I was working on my final year project. Honestly I have spent more time fooling around than actually working.

[edit:]

Took this from Paws:

HUH?! Personally I find the test a bit too easy… But then again, probably I was wrong because I DID score low for the expert level. Hmm… But at least I should have scored better compared to my peers. *evil grins >=P* (and I'm proud to have a great command of English :p)
