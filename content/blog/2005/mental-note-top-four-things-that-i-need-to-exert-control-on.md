Just to make a mental note or else I might forget it later, as I notice that a few things which aren't good for my health, physical or not, if I take or do it with excess. So the top four things that I need to keep tabs with and control are:

4. **Orange Juice**

    As much as I really like drinks made from anything citrus, too much of them would give me the coughs, which is not fun :(.

3. **Sugar intake**

    I don't know whether it is my metabolism rate or is it my body condition, I do notice that an overdose of sweets or sugar intake would make me hyperactive and causing heartburns (well… not exactly a heartburn by definition, but I do feel the chest pain). And this heart burning sensation lasts for hours, which makes me hard to concentrate on my work. As much as I know one way to get rid of the heartburn momentarily, I believe overdoing that would be equally as bad, since it involves me going into the bathroom. (Don't ask what I'm doing in there :p)

2. **The Internet**

    Yup, you read that right. Somehow I just noticed that when I'm starting to have some sort of obsession to it, it does somehow make me feel detached from real life, which does cause some constant depression of sorts. Not to mention that when I get online when I'm depressed, I tend to be much more of an attention whore, then more depression would have set in later whether or not I got the "attention" or not (In the end I'll still feel the emptiness anyway).

    Not to mention that dial-up charges are pretty expensive over here…

1. **eBay!!!**

    GAH! I believe I have spent too much on bidding stuff over eBay, which does ends up with a really long debit card bill. Not as scary as a credit card bill, but still I have been seeing an alarming cash outflow x\_x".

Must keep tabs on my cash lately as I am planning to get some new clothes, get myself some webspace as well as planning an overseas trip (the States, woo :D) within 3 years time. Not to mention that I might need that extra cash if I ever plan to further my studies. (Damn I have a long wish list :p)

*[Question to people going to ACen this year: How much should I budget as expenses if I plan to go there? And probably how much travel expenses would I need if I plan to stay for a week?]*

In other news, just having fun with the SNES emulator. :) Just finished with YsIII: Wanderers of Ys within 2 days. Would continue with FF6 once I have the extra time.
