I "discovered" this quite unexpectedly, that this line is written on a page by a friend of mine.

“或许放弃及损失，在许多情况下，并不是错误的决定，最终还会让自己获得更多。”

Translation: "Maybe (something will cause you to) give up and being at a loss, but a lot of times, it is not the wrong decision, in the end it'll let benefit you even more."

I'll leave the interpretation to you all :).
