OK, nothing much these days, except the fact that I was really tired after my trip to Kinokuniya yesterday, so tired that I plunk on my bed as soon as I got home. Got a lot of Japanese stuff, as in one Japanese dictionary, yet-another-Japanese grammar guide, then 3 more Fruitsbaskets <333. Wee~ I'm starting a collection.

And OMG there's just TOO MUCH EUROBEAT in eBay that I.need.something.to.stop.me.from.overbidding. OK, I resisted the temptation by putting them on my watchlist (since usually I won't buy from there :p). But I'm currently bidding a few that I really wanted. If my plans goes well I'll be able to complete the major non-stop megamixes (i.e. the 10's) from SEB60-SEB120, which, in my opinion, greatly represents the second-latter and beginning-third (edit: Hmmâ€¦ weird way of putting it XDDD) Para boom period.

What else, oh yeah! I'm going back to my hometown tommorrow :). So I get to see my parents and my brother again. I miss them so ;___;.
