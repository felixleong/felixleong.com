Just sitting around here while I'm waiting for the videos to get uploaded so that Nine can edit them. And since it's like 100MBs or so with an upload speed of 11KBps isn't exactly all that funny, but at least it's better than doing it on dialup X(. Gah I do need QuickTime Pro X(!

Feeling a bit light-headed today for some unknown reasons, I really wonder why this is happening though. It's like I'm on alcohol or drugs or something but in actual fact I really hate them. Hmmâ€¦ Probably I'm a bit sensitive or something (or am I?) :p

Other than that guess I really need to work out my stuff later on.
