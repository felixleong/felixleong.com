心，又生病了。

或许是营养不良的关系吧…还是有些不均衡的存在吧…

明明距离就是那么的接近，却克制了自己去抓紧你。…是害怕吗？总是觉得自己少了些什么的样子。

有些美丽的话语，收在心里太久了：开始变了质。这样不新鲜的爱意，真的是要自行去解决：因为我真的是不要让你中毒。

所以，就让自己病到了。

或许自己真的是好傻…

My heart is falling ill again.

Maybe it's malnourished, or probably there's some imbalance exists…

Even with our distance　so close, yet I resisted myself to hold you tight. … Is it that I'm afraid? I always feel as if I'm short of something.

Some beautiful words, kept too long in my heart: starting to turn sour. This kind of stale feelings, it's really something that I have to settle by myself: because I really don't want you to get poisoned because of it.

Therefore, I let myself fall ill.

Maybe I'm just really that foolish…
