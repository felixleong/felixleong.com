As said, probably death is only the end in the perception of our own dimension of physical reality… Come to think of it… What is actually lost in the event of one's death? Come to think about it, it's really a very interesting thought…

From my current line of thoughts, death can probably be viewed not as a lost of something physical in existence, but a lost of an illusionary dream/mind. OK, probably that's too abstract, putting it in an example: when someone/thing dies, the impact that it'll cause will only be determined by one's perception, value and importance of everything surrounding it. As humans, we often construct tons of mental perceptions towards those which are within our physical bounds of existence. This can mean a lot of things: A need, a desire, a dream, a perception, an image…

Thinking from that light, one's death doesn't really cause one cease to exist, but it'll cause these mental perceptions of the people surrounding it to crumble down. "What can a dead man do in the physical plane?" And that itself cause people to think that it's an end, but this end is only a perception from the "living" person's point of view but not of the "dead".

… Hmm… probably I believe that I would need to understand more about the human ego and the "presence" of one's being in existence (I used your terminology, but it's a good word choice indeed :D).

P/S: I just notice that the "XO" smiley kinda resembles a symbol that can be interpreted as provided that two tangent lines being drawn on a circle being drawn close enough to each other and long enough, there's a possibility that two tangent lines will cross each other.

That itself has quite a deep philosophical meaning on it's own ;). (and probably it can also make a good math joke :p)
