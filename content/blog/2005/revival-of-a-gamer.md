The good thing is that Grandia II (PC) came into the mail yesterday. The bad thing is that because of that I'm late for work (i.e. played Grandia II until late at night). ^-^|| The initial battle with Millenia bug really wasted my time XDDD.

I wonder what will happen if I happened to get Final Fantasy IX (PS) next monthâ€¦? :p

Anyway, for those who frequent eBay for games, I really need to know how am I suppose to recognize a legit copy of the game from bootlegs? Your help will be greatly appreciated ^-^b.
