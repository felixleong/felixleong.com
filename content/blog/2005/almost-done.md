After a whole day of marathoning The Count of Monte Cristo, I'm just need to complete the last, climatic 100 pages of reading. And damn this has to be one of the longest novel I have read since The Lord of The Rings as I'm reading the original, English translated version of the novel which spans about 1100 pages (including the translation notes) in 7.5 pt font. O\_O||

But anyway, it's really a good read :). Although I do have to say that the heavy references of the French Revolution really put me off initially (I admit the fact that I really suck in history, in fact I have almost forgotten all historical facts that I can muster :p. And as an additional mention, this is my second attempt to "conquer" this novel).

I guess I'll revert back to some lighter reading material before I attempt thsee heavyweight stuff.
