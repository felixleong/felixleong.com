## #1:

Somehow these days are still a lot of thesis work… well… seeing that the due date is coming around the corner. I'm getting a bit worried with my work as I do it, I wonder whether was that perfectionism, or am I really worried? Because knowing my personality, I just have that gung-ho attitude which seems to get a lot of excitement for getting things done during the very last minute (and I DO mean that get the most of the work done at the VERY last minute). And I believe I just came to a point like I'm wearing myself out because of that.

Honestly speaking, if I were to manage myself better, most probably I should have finish my work extremely early so that I don't have to worry about it at all later. But then it just seems that I kept on repeating it, just because it seems that I'm "addicted" to the "kicks" it gave me, which I believe is not really a good thing. And thinking about it, what do I get in the end? Does the unnecessary stress really worth the trouble? Personally I just can't see the worth of doing it, as I have notice that quality of my own work is going down to a point that I'd say that they suck. As much people have been telling me that my work has been great all the while, I just can't seem to convince myself that my work is actually good because they just doesn't seem to reach my own (perhaps overly) high standards that I have set for myself.

Looking at my own work for my final year project, it just seems that my work is more of a disappointment to me. Well, I know what I'm doing now have a much higher level of difficulty compared to most of my peers (as my work is heavily based on another master's thesis, but then again, the paper is like… 5 years ago?), but it justs seems to fall extremely short from my own expectations. Honestly speaking, I was wondering whether is it that I'm pushing myself too hard? But looking back, it just seems that I'm slacking too much instead (as in I played more than I have actually worked… I believe it works out to a margin like 80:20?).

So if I feel so bad about spending way too much time fooling around, why I just force myself to gather enough willpower to change that… instead of ranting this all over my LJ (which is EXACTLY what I'm doing now)?

And so I'll be graduating in two months time. Personally I have been having quite a lot of self doubt actually as much as I believe that everything has been pretty much settled. It's like, I know I'll be getting a job offer and I'll be starting to earn my own living starting from May; I know that even if I don't get my job offer, I standing a better chance in getting another job with the qualifications I had; or even I never get a job after my graduations, I'll always have my parents to fall back to, or I might as well spend some time getting some rest after all I have been through: But still… I'm still not feeling confident enough myself that I'm going to cope with what's coming in the future.

Personally speaking, even if I never got a job, I originally had plans to continue my studies overseas. But looking at my current situation… it just seems that I have lost almost all my motivation to continue to study. Well… I know that it's temporary, but then again… it's like… I don't know, I just feel like putting my study plans aside for a while. It's like… I would like to take a break from studies after all I have been through.

…

I think I've think too far away in time, worrying too much about everything which had never happened yet. But then, the anxiety is really killing me…

Maybe I would as well focus on my final year project and getting it done. And I really hoped that the job offer letter gets in my mailbox sooner… or never (if that's a viable possibility).

[:: offtopic ::]
Speaking of anxiety, my Tora Tora Tora album haven't arrived yet :(. It's like I'm fretting all these little matters, especially after I notice that my album is sent using SAL, which is usually slower than normal airmail.

Probably I'm thinking of buying Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks as a present once I got my project done.
