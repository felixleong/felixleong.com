Happy mother's day to all mothers in the world :). Raising kids is always the hardest, most challenging task in the whole wide world in the first place.

Anyway, just came back from a talk just now. OK, honestly it is supposed to be a graduation night of my friend, and it turns out to be a graduation night of a short course in Crown Vision International. And for those who knows pretty well, that means that it just have to a lot of Amway stuff. But somehow after going through the whole thing, I'm starting to see why these people are so enthusiastic about it and manage to attract people to it. And I'm starting to see and understand what the business and management books are all hyping about: That one of the most critical thing about managing a successful business is the culture of the company; and what we are selling now is not the product, but more of a perception towards the product and company.

I think these two thoughts are worth delving more into, guess I might post more thoughts next time.
