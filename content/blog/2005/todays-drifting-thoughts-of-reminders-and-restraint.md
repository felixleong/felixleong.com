Sometimes I just need a reminder that if I'm taking an emotional break, that is equivalent to enjoying some peace and quiet that has been given to me.

Just that… There are some feelings that I still keep to myself, restraining it… The very same feeling that I had the in the past but to a much lesser degree (Probably it's a "Deja vu" to some) It's not that it's bothering or depresses me or anything, just that I still feel a bit uneasy… It's like, I still hold the strong belief of making sure one's feelings and accessing the situation before committing myself to it, just that from time to time I feel as if I have been challenged again and again… Sometimes I feel as if I'm restraining myself to a point that I feel as I have become an impenetrable stone.

I'm still learning how to enjoy some of the little pleasures that comes from the feeling I had without any thoughts of attachment… and still it's a really big challenge to me.

… Just one of those small desires that I had… that I really wondered that I have the ability to attain… And the secret little box that stores it get close once again…
