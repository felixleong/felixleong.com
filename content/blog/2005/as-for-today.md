And as for today, Stanley dropped by to Kuala Lumpur today. It's came to a very shocking surprise to see him completely different -- at least physically. He seems to be more physically fit and stylish. Hmm… does make me wonder what actually happened to him? :p (This kinda remind me: How shocked people are when I do my image change? LOL) He came with his friend, Danny, and he's currently studying in UTAR (which is the same university that I graduated from). We get to chat a lot and it's pretty fun :).

And what really surprising is that I never expect to see Super Dance Freak (SDF) volume 84 here in Malaysia :D. Not to mention that it's in the budget corner as well :D. Snatched it together with S.E.S.'s Friend CD (Yes, I'm starting to expose myself to Kpop) as well. Originally I was crying foul over the running length of Friend (38 minutes), it really made me scream "WHAT A RIP OFF!" XD But soon after I found myself loving the S.E.S.'s album instantly :D. I still hate it being so damn short because it really made me wanting for more of their music. Super Dance Freak is also a great CD as well, it really spans a lot of dance tunes and genres. It really spice up the variety of my own music library :D. Not to mention that it had techno that is not boring at all :D.

I did saw a few Europop and JPop albums that I wanted as well (Captian Jack, smile.dk). I guess I save those for later ;).

Currently having fun with my tablet. Now what I need now is to get my web pages designed well :D.
