*"Hearing 'I'll always be here…' from you seems to me like a fantasy… And all I can do now is to smile to you from afar… "*

All I wanted to say is… I'll always be the same deep down, but there're some things that will never be the same anymore.

On a light note, I dyed my hair again. This time to golden ash. This time round I do the Gatsby Xtreme Colouring where it involves the two step process where you have to use their EX-High bleach to bleach your hair to a extremely light brown colour (more like yellow to me), then later on use their bleach colours of choice.

Honestly speaking… well… for my first attempt to dye my hair to a much lighter colour this time round, I consider it more as a blunder. OK, first step, the bleaching part, I'm extremely happy when I finally got my hair to have a much orange-y brown colour (Somewhat I do feel like I'm Kyou in Fruitsbasket :p), but only to realise later that the nape and the hairs behind my ears aren't dyed at all >.<". So it's like… the most parts of the hair is brownish but with tints of black, together with a big patch of black at the back of it. Meh… ;\_\_\_;

Then later on, I put on the golden ash dye… but it seems that the final results wasn't that satisfying in the end. (well… perhaps not under flourescent light…) It looks more or less the same colour I used to have, only lighter with some *extremely* light gold tint. ;\_\_\_;

Oh well… probably I will get another bottle of EX-Hi Bleach next month :p.

Before this…

Obviously I have been tweaking with the colours via software. But only brightness and contrast adjustments only :).
