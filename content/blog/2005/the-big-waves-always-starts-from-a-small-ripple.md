title: The Big Waves Always Starts From A Small Ripple

The funny thing is that just as I mentioned things are getting uneventful, all of a sudden things just get an unpredictable turn as a surprising wave seems to sweep me away…

But honestly speaking there isn't anything major happening yesterday, just that just out of the blue Erika chatted with me on MSN, then later on Choon Hui came to my house for a while to do some stuff. As much as these two events are considered trivial in the eyes of others, it really hard to describe the feeling that I had: a mixture of excitement, happiness, sorrow, sadness… and probably some sprinkles of faked indifference.

But I'm just glad… that I'm still in contact with Choon Hui. As much I know where the line is between the both of us, it did made me realize that everything concerns, relates or happens to something very precious to me really counts… no matter how small the matter is.

… Anyway, sentimentalism aside (and an unrelated note), just got my hair dyed back to a much lighter brown. I was expecting to get some impressive DIY highlights myself, but it didn't really turn out well ^^". Probably I might need to get professional service next time round (but then again, I hate the idea of spending money, knowing how expesive it can be)… Or maybe I should as well try to find where I can get those DIY kits specially for highlighting (I know these products does exist, at least in the US).

And I'm really looking forward to tommorow's karaoke appointment with my colleagues/friends :)! Till then… I have to work on the task on hand now ^^".
