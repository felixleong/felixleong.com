Phew! Finally done with my virtual reality assignment, and I'm really glad that the final output looks awesome :). Great thanks to my group members in making this a blast! :D (especially Chong Seng who did the trees and flowers :D)

Anyway, enough talk~ Here's the cool stuff :):

(Note: These are rendered slightly before I do some final modification to the garden, so it does looks a little bit different from the final garden in the video. I'll post them up next time)
