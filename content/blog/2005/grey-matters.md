今日日本語のクラスで動詞の辞書形を習って、とても難いだね。でも、大丈夫です。

Yeah, it's been a while I haven't been doing the photo posts again ^^.

Anyway, apart from getting the blues (read CODS), the post whores in our University's online forum is starting to get on my nerves. Well… as much it wasn't anywhere close to what RPGamer used to have (read: Wyvernlord and Lord Dycerag… *shivers…*), I really hate to see people posting meaningless post which contributes nothing, especially when these posts appears in serious discussion threads. What do they think an online forum is? A chatroom?!

Ugh… whoever had moderated the RPGamer boards during their existences has definitely get my salutes (I believe Rico was one of them).

Now let me think of how to shoot them down… seriously.
