title: When Things Are Getting Smoother

It does seems that today that I just have that feeling of starting to get the hang of the job. It's quite interesting to see that all the hard work is starting to see some sort of progress, no matter how small that is.

And as things turns out, I came to an affirmation that I do need 6 to 8 hours of sleep in order to have a fresh day. As much that means that I would have to sacrifice my usual lifestyle and have to make sure that I need to sleep as early as 11 (although this shouldn't be counted as "early" by some standards). And this sacrifice is definitely worth it as I do find the thrill and motivation when I'm much more awake and alert. But somehow the only gripe is that my daily para practice is disrupted as I find myself not doing much of it for the past two weeks. But I suppose I do need to dedicate more time to familiarize myself with the job.

In other news, I have been spending time lurking around Friendster these days as I started to search for the profiles of my old friends. Not to mention that I have been sending quite a lot of email to friends and stuff, and somehow I just have that feeling of trying to find some way to reconnect to them.

Will be going back home tomorrow. Just gotta miss my family :).
