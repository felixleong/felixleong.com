Good news: My SEB130 came in the mail today.

Bad news: The asian edition only comes in two CDs .\_.

Frustrating news: It was stated in HMV that it only comes in two CD, and I thought it meant that the shipping cost was calculated as two CDs. Apparently I was wrong.

Worst news: Actually with the money I spent to buy this CD, I can grab it off from [ClubJapan](http://www.clubjapan.jp/) at almost the same price!

GAH! *pounds self like no end*

Anyway, I'm thinking of buying the Japanese version next month, considering that YesAsia sold out their stock of their Parapara Paradise arcade soundtrack. >\_< But then again… I really setting myself in some sort of a dilemma, since I'm thinking of getting some web space, and there's a lot of travel plans that was planned ahead. YEOUCH! X(

In other news, I feel kinda stressed out at work… Well… I guess the sudden pile of workload really scares me. But then again, thinking back, this is not the first time I feel that way ^^". Guess there's a lot that I need to learn along the way.

Step 1: Frustration management :p.

Now… let me just set up some eBay traps to capture the SEB volumes that I want…

[::Just for my own reference::]

I think I might as well cool myself down a little, now I'm feeling damn impulsive to buy something to get rid of my frustration ^^"
