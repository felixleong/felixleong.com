These few days I have been doing more English work than programming, all because of a technical specification I have written, which is meant to challenge the techincal editor recruits (and believe me, I have the knack of putting up a challenge for myself and others :p).

And no doubt I'm proud that my pre-school education (I was home schooled in English before I enrolled in Chinese medium kindergarten), years of being secretaries for societies and my love for languages and writing has paid off :). But probably that also means that my workload will be increased? But I don't mind if I can learn things from this experience. ^-^ (Yet again, my purpose here is to do programming/development work. ARGH! The dillema XDD)

In other news, I'm now reading The Leader In You by Levine & Crom (Dale Carnegie & Associates). I think I can finish it in 3~5 hours, considering that it's ultra thin compared to The Count of Monte Cristo XD.

Other than that… been having an icky-achy-heart. *wishes for hugs* ;\_\_\_; But I will overcome it somehow… someday (MAX's cover of Sunday running in my head)…
