title: Ouch! The Pain of Failure!

Just got my marked research project back from my boss, and truth to be told, it's not beautiful at all as major portions of my answer paper got the red ink: which looks as if it was badly tainted by blood after a kill. And boy it's not only a bad sight, it's downright dreadful.

OK, it may not seem that bad as it's a 5.5 out of 10, but by my oridinary standards this is as good as disaster. The only time when I tolerate this kind of standard is that when I don't really liked something.

But for some reasons, I don't really feel hurt to a point of crying. I still remember vividly how all the small failures would make me break down to tears. Yes, I do feel hurt now, but somehow I just got over with it and feel as if I can get up straight away and move on. In fact I can daresay that this has already become my own motivation to become a better person.

I don't know, probably learning from past hurts and pain is a part of growing up? From what I'm able to see from here, it seems that I have a long journey to go, more challenges to face and more experiences to be gained. But I'm really looking forward to that :).
