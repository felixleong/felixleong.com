Grandma Kiew has been hospitalised today, currently she's in the HDU (high dependency unit, whatever that is). And by the looks and description from my aunt, her situation is a bit worrying. I'm not sure what will happen to her, but I did noticed that for the past few days she isn't feeling that well.

I'm not too sure about the seriousness of her conditionâ€¦ but then I'm concerned. So for those who are reading this, please pray for her safety and hope she'll be OK.
