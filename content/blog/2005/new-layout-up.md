I have just put up the layout changes for my LJ :D. It's not perfect, but I think I'll fine tune it later.

Come and have a look at it! (If you read this entry from a Friends page :) )

*[Note: I have only tested it on IE6 and Firefox 1.0.7. In case anyone uses a different browser, i.e. Opera or older browsers, do let me know if there's any problems with it]*

In other news, life goes on as I clumsily live my own life… Still practicing what it is to live life to the fullest… without constant analysis with my surroundings. (Does that make me live with my gut feelings? Hmm…)

Could use with real-life training and mentoring. :)

*[Update @ 2:30pm]*

Made some CSS tweaks, and since I just love the stars, I just fixed it in place in the window :3. And it's pretty neat to see them like "moving" around (or "falls down/rising up") in the page :D.

Yay for optical illusion.
