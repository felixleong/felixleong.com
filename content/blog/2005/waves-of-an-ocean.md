Slow day it is today as I'm staying back at home to work on some web design today. Nothing much happened yesterday either as I find myself buying Fruits Basket 10 and 11 for myself and Fuushigi Yuugi Part II 4 (FC Premium edition, which comes with a mini drama CD) for my sister. Still need to get the Chinese edition of Fruits Basket 17 before I mail it to her :).

Then I got my portrait shoot of my family during my graduation:

(I guess I didn't need to do much explaining: my mother is on sitting on the left while my father is on the right)

Then I bleached my hair again, now it takes more of a bright orange hue.

Other than that, I have been sneezing very badly today, probably a sign that I'm not taking care of my body well. Been experiencing some emotional ripples as wellâ€¦ So it's like, downbeat mood for quite some time. And I'm still trying to adjust myself in many way, especially when it comes to opening up and letting go.
