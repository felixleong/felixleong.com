Just a quote from my friend.

Sometimes stupid people can really get on my nerves. Can't people just use some common sense before talking? Which type of people who annoys me the most? Offensive people who think that they are far superior than everybody else and thinks that he/she has the right to offend/screw up everybody, and expects people NOT to take offence. Sheesh… >=(

In other news, it's a slow day today. But I do find myself spending too much time to sort out our university's online forum. Bleh…
