What a night today :), umm… yesterday (XD). It's kinda interesting really as Theen Gee and I spent almost hours just having deep discussions regarding a lot of different topics, from the essense of religious faith, the meaning of life, Buddishm, relationship and even sexuality matters! (Well… having him as my temporary roommate, I believe that he has the right to know. Besides, Steven DID drop quite a lot of hints to him previously)

It's really exciting throughout the whole discussion as it's been quite a while ever since I get a chance to have someone to have deep discussions with. I believe the last time I ever had these kind of discussion is probably with Ahmed, but then again, it was like… say… 4 months ago? o\_O"

But one thing I do found out is that all the time I spent pondering some drifting thoughts and the hurdles I have been through in the past does change me quite a lot: in terms of physical, emotional and spiritual change. During the discussion, I find myself expressing some of my own deeper thoughts and difficult philosophies which I aren't able to do so a while back. Somehow I just have that sense of accomplishment after all this deep discussion. As much I believe that there's still a lot of room for improvement myself, it's really a good start :).

Anyway, it's kinda late now (ummm… it's like…. 4 in the morning O\_O"). Probably I'll be posting more thoughts when I have time to think about them :).
