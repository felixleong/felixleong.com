Bit by bit, I'm still learning how to cope with what I thought was habits in the past. Little that I knew that these are merely traits that reflects back on my own fears, insecurities, anxiety and worries… Fear that I don't get accepted, fear that I'm unable to get what I wanted, fear that I'm unable to achieve what I expected, fear that everything will be taken away from me, fear that I'm not worthy enough… Each and every time, I constantly find myself shrinking back timidly.

Only that I knew that it's really not something that can be modified or repressed: It's completely impossible to do so, because these traits are part of my own defence mechanism. Only that I knew that to cure these traits is to understand what fear is.

Now… take a deep breath… Taking these strong emotions slowly… one at a time….

… Guess I still need some time and practice to get this right…
