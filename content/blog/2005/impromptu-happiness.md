总是含着泪水悄悄的祝福你，希望你幸福。

现在猛然发觉到：“幸福”的真正意思…到底是什么？

原来才发现到自己连“幸福”的定义也不晓得——才发现那份祝福也只是如此的表面虚幻。

才发现我原来根本都没有真正去了解你。

Always having tears welling in my eyes, I made a silent prayer, wishing that you'll happy.

Now I suddenly notice that: What is the real meaning of "happiness"?

Only that I notice that I don't even understand the real meaning of "happiness" myself -- only that I notice that wish of mine is just shallow and illusionary.

Only I notice that I never actually tried to understand you.
