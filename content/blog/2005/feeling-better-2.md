After tons of coke, water and rest, finally I feel much more healthier now. The only thing is that I'm still having the sore throat, so probably I need more water to get that fixed.

Tommorrow's my combinatronics mid-term. Still struggling with it.

p/s: Speaking of eBay, somehow I did notice there's a CD series from Spain named "I Love Disco Diamonds". From what I have search through online, it seems to contain a lot of the lesser know italo-disco and Eurobeat tracks. Hmm… I wonder how good they are.

[Anyway, here's their site. Basically it's only an online shop, but anyway:](http://blancoynegro.com/)
