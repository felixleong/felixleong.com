For some reasons the electrical supply doesn't seem to be really stable today as I witness some really nasty electrical surges going on around my house. So I have quite a lot of really annoying moments of flickering lights in the whole house, and which also means that I can't use the computer much as I'm worried about the fact that it might spoil my computer. And the bad news is that I have two assignments that needs to be handed up this week. Grr…

But at least I have some time to actually sit down and watch some TV. Honestly I'm not much of a TV person and i really have survived without TV for like… 6 months? But yeah it's cool :). Watched Fear Factor today and somehow it just came to me that sometimes your mind can really screw you up. As much it is easier to say don't give up, it really needs a strong mind and determination to actually walk the talk.

Anyway, the current is much more stable right now, apart from some constant but slight light flickers, hope everything is going to be fine (and I can concentrate on my work without giving myself a headache because of this current condition).

Matte ne~!
