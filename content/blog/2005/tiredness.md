Just feeling so tired ~~today~~ yesterday that I spent most of the time sleeping. Not feeling really top notch physically, in fact I feel extremely sickly/sluggish. T^T

And somehow there's a lot of things that I wanted to buy. I was introduced to [ClubJapan](http://www.clubjapan.jp/) which is pretty awesome because it has free shipping with 5% handling fees, which is far cheaper than the likes of CDJapan and HMV. The catch? Everything is in Japanese and I'm almost struggling because my Japanese skills are pretty limited. But somehow I manage to wade through the procedures and tried to buy PPP6 & 7 soundtracks from that site. Hopefully it'll be a smooth transaction.

There's just too much things I would want to buy… But anyway, I'll be meeting up with William tommorrow to invest in some unit trusts. Probably this will mark the start of my financial planning ;).

If anyone's wondering why a LJ entry at 3 in the morning… I just slept ^^".

Oh yeah! Happy birthday to girljinbink! ^o^
