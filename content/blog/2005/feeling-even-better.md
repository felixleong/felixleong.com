What a great feeling :). It's like I'm so glad that my health is improving by the day, and apparently my mood gets cheery day by day with my health conditions. I wonder why ^^. It just seems that during the times when I'm feeling sickly, I was so bogged down by the viruses that I have no room to think about all those depressing stuff? Or probably I'm just only stressed out that causes the sickness? Hmmâ€¦

And apparent, all of a sudden everything seems to go my way. It's like, everything I do just seem to go so smoothly that I never expect it. Maybe it's just my lucky day? :)

Yeah, the combinatronic midterm is over, so yay for that :D. And I think I fare better than my quizzes (speaking of which, I got my first 0 during my first quiz, which is REALLY depressing XD). Hopefully I can catch up with my school stuff soon. But then again, probably my bad habit of proscatination will get in the way :p. Ah well~

Somewhat I'm in love with Lolita's Highway. It's featured in both my SEB80 and 90 and it really sounded really different and unique compared to other Elena (for those who's not into Eurobeat, Lolita is one of the many aliases she sings as) tracks. It's like, well, to me, it's like almost all Lolita and Virginelle songs sounds almost similar, and Highway seems to strike a complete contrast to her usual style (Almost like Magical Lover sang by Norma Sheffield in SEB75, which sounds more like Virginelle track than a Norma). I wonder whether Vicky have listened to that before. ^^

Guess that pretty much wraps up my normal day.
