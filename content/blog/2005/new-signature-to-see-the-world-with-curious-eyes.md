More often than not, these signatures really reflect on my current situations and thoughts :). So I guess it's time for a new signature ^^.

I'm reverting to the smaller format which I used to use over RPGamer's forums (250 x 75 pixels). It's basically hard work to cram a lot of things inside it, but I do find it appealing ^^.

For some reasons though, I just find the signature a bitâ€¦ well, glaring, sort make me hard to see my signature properly without looking away from my monitor from time to time ^^". Probably it's because of the extremely clashing blue (but then I really wanted the shade of blue there) or the very bright red I used. Ah~ Probably if that's really the case I'll change a new one pretty shortly ^^".
