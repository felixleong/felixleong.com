<a href="http://www.felixleong.com/">FelixLeong.com</a> is currently up with my old site, Felix Leong presents PEDAGOGIES (which I suppose some <a href="http://www.rpgamer.com/">RPGamer</a> boardies know that it&apos;s my manga drawing tutorial site when I was active in Fanart section). I didn&apos;t do any changes since the last update three years ago, but that&apos;s about to change ;).

And another thing is that I just learnt the paras for Stay The Night / Dave Rodgers and I Love You Babe / King & Queen, which means that I have completed with learning all the paras in Parapara Paradise 1! :D Planning to conquer the remaining few that I haven&apos;t learn in PPP2. And one thing is that I really liked Stay The Night, as in both the song and the para! Luckily the well known Maki&apos;s Biggest PPP Blunder didn&apos;t happen to me (otherwise most likely I&apos;ll hit furniture XDDDD). I just feel so energetic doing that para :D.

Anyway, back to work! :D
