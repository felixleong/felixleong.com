Without any concious effort or thoughts, feelings seems to resurface from depths.

The feeling of heartaches pricking…
A sorrow without tears…
A fear of the unknown…

The very same feeling that seems to revisit every once in a while… gradually decreasing in intensity but yet will not perish… like the ripples of the pond which which reverberate on the vast surface…
