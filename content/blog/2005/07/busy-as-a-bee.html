<hr />
Apparently the phone line got loose again and I need to call in the technician again.

Anyway, yesterday&apos;s recap: It&apos;s been a busy day yesterday as I literally running around the office when we got the new PCs set up for our new colleagues :). The office is just full of activity as everyone worked together to get everything up as soon as possible, and just that experience alone is really enjoyable. I really love the cooperative and friendly atmosphere around here, and it really motivates me every single weekday here :).

And so we have 6 spanking new, cool, black-and-silvered coloured HPs in the office, and ooh~ I&apos;m so envious :p. The boss aren&apos;t really fond of them though as he said that "it doesn&apos;t go with the furniture" XD. He&apos;s frank as usual :).

Other than that, after all the hustles and bustles, everything is pretty peaceful around here :).

Just fooled around with my photo album yesterday as I worked on the photographs yesterday, and I realized that I have tons of photos that I forgot to distribute. Oops! I&apos;m trying to get it done by today so that will mean one less thing to worry about :).

So, as for the photos, here&apos;s the photos that I shot yesterday:

Just a sidenote, the photographic intro image is currently set as my wallpaper (and it&apos;s my favourite photo that I took as well :D).
