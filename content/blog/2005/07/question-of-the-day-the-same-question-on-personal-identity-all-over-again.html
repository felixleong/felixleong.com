Who am I in the eyes of others? Am I being my true self, or is it just a mere act on my part to reveal only the best in me? Why is it that I&apos;m so concerned about my actions to a point of perfectionism where no mistakes is allowed? Is it that hard to take valid criticism with an open heart without being defensive?

Coming back… what is the "true self" in the first place…?
