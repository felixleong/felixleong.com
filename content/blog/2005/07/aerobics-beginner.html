Phew! Just came back from my first class in aerobics. And phew it&apos;s really intense and it does work the whole body out! *Feel muscle strains* But it&apos;s really fun :), probably not as fun as para, but it&apos;s kinda interesting to learn out the steps and everything :D.

The teacher commented that I&apos;m a fast learner in this, which is quite a complement to me :). Probably having some sense of rhythm and para practice does help a lot in this? Heh heh :p

I&apos;m looking forward to the next class! Hope it&apos;s going to be more fun. (Hopefully the intensity doesn&apos;t go far beyond my reach, but that&apos;s a good challenge to me :))
