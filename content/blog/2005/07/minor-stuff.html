Hmm… not really a bombastic day today, here&apos;s the run down on stuff:
- Boss is out to Singapore today, and at the same time my task on hand is completed. So today is almost like a holiday for most of us in the department today (not as in no work to do, but that our workload is significantly less than what we had in the past few weeks) :). And we have a special lunch today as we go to Ampang (which is like a 20 minutes drive from our office) to have yong tau fu (A humble Chinese delicacy here ;), see note). Hmmm~ Nice :) Then most of the time in the office is spent laughing away with a lot of jokes and everything.

- Listening to Ayu&apos;s Endless sorrow on my way to the LRT, and gosh that song really made me cry *-*. It&apos;s really a good relief after having my down-ish mood for the past few days. Currently I&apos;m learning to sing along with the song, and luckily the lyrics are very short and memorable ;).

- Aerobics class today is really fun :D. I&apos;m loving it, of course I also have to admit that I&apos;m still finding inspiration to choreo some new original parapara dances.

- I feel irritated with people sometimes, especially when the chat goes like

"Hey! I need your help!" OK, sure!
"[Insert request here]" Umm… I don&apos;t know anything about it.
"Oh. OK. Bye."
Sometimes I wonder where the courtesy goes… Is it that hard to say even one "Thank you" for the time? OK, I have to admit that I did that mistake a lot of times so I better shut up :(.

- Lots of chores to be done tommorrow *-*".

<i>*Note:</i>

I suppose yong tau fu would be almost an alien term to non-Malaysians, so this is a good description that I&apos;m able to search from the Internet:
"OK, now to the food. By the way, who hasn&apos;t tried Yong Tau Foo? YTFs are actually fish paste stuffed into items like smooth taufoo, ladies fingers, fried taufoo, chillies or sliced brinjals. You can also find them wrapped in thin soya skin (dumpling) which are then served in a soup or fried." -- from FriedChillies.com
