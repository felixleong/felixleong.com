Today&apos;s round-up:
- I went back to my University this morning and settled all the required procedures of my convocation :). So that means that August will be a memorable month for me and my family. Met Xian Yi and his girlfriend today by coincidence and we have lunch together, catch up with a lot of stuff actually and it was fun.

- I purposely go to Midvalley to get this:

Basically the <a href="http://www.cancer.org.my">National Cancer Society Malaysia</a> is holding a cancer awareness and charity campaign which sells designer wristbands (from Topshop) for RM10, and all proceeds will go to this charity in giving education about cancer and support to cancer patients. The wristbands come with four colours with different keywords on them: White for "Think", Green for "Act", Red for "Feel" and I can&apos;t seem to remember what blue stands for. (If my memory serves me right, that is ^^", but I&apos;m sure about the colours though ;) )

I got the white one that reads "Think", honestly speaking I was a bit indecisive between the blue and the white (and somehow I do like the red one as well), but somehow I picked the white one. I don&apos;t know, it really reflects my personality a lot and I believe that it tells a lot about myself ;). And it looked so cool that I think I&apos;ll be wearing it even when I&apos;m in the office :).

Anyway, here&apos;s a picture of me with the wrist band on (and now you&apos;ll see my black hair which I have dyed a few weeks ago).

- Somehow I&apos;m having a feeling that Chapter 4 in In Hues of Blue is going to start sometime soonâ€¦ We&apos;ll see how things turns out ;). Till then, my wish is that whatever change may come, it&apos;ll bring benefit to both others and myself.
