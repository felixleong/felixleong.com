Domino's 1, 2, Santos is definitely yummy :D! Although it took me some painstaking hours to get it encoded into MP3 without having it sound muffled D:. Anyway, for those who are interested, just grab [dbpowerAMP Music Convertor](http://www.dbpoweramp.com/) (freeware) and use the dMC Auxiliary Input program that comes with it. This software saved me from more agony (I'm using a lame wave recorder before that).

Anyway, it's really worth the 210yen ;), for those who are interested can go to [@Music](http://atmusic.avexnet.or.jp/wma/index.asp) and have a look. (It's in Japanese, BTW)

I'm grabbing Wild Reputation 2005 (Grand Mix) now, and I'm going to pay for it tomorrow (since my bank made a restriction that I can only make 1 online shopping transaction per day). And I'm sure that it's going to be good :D.

[sidenote: OH GAWD! Princess F's Shadows In The Night (Extended Version) is there too <333. I think I better resist from buying that one ;p. Probably I'm better off waiting for Eurobeat Flash show up in eBay.]
