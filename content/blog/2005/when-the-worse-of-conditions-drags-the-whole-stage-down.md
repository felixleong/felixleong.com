In case anyone is wondering what happened for the past two days, I have a the worst case of illness for the years that I can remember. Probably because of a nastier flu or food poisoning. Sparing you with the gruesome details, all I can say that these two days I have been having a fever, two occasions of vomit, endless stream of diarrhoea (GOD this is hard to spell!), nasty bloating together with lots of burping, lost of appetite, having my head feeling like a helium ballon in one occassion and other minor nuisances.

Just don't ask me any sort of Nickolodeon-style "gross" questions :p.

But somehow I feel a lot better after this, physically (well… not quite, as I'm still recovering from it) and emotionally. As if some burden has been thrown up and flushed into the toilet bowl. Guess I really needed that at this point of time, so thinking about it it wasn't that bad afterall.

But then again… My work is piling up in my workplace! I'll make sure that I'll do my best to finish them :). Wish me luck!
