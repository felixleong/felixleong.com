## MISIA / Everything

*from:* http://users.skynet.be/roxfan/lyrics/misc/177.html

すれ違う時の中で　あなたとめぐり逢えた  
不思議ね　願った奇跡が　こんなにも側にあるなんて

逢いたい想いのまま　逢えない時間だけが　過ぎてく扉　すり抜けて  
また思い出して　あの人と笑い合う　あなたを

愛しき人よ　悲しませないで　泣き疲れて　眠る夜もあるから  
過去を見ないで　見つめて　私だけ

You're everything You're everything  
あなたが想うより強く　やさしい嘘ならいらない　欲しいのはあなた

どれくらいの時間を　永遠と呼べるだろう　果てしなく　遠い未来なら  
あなたと行きたい　あなたと覗いてみたい　その日を

愛しき人よ　抱きしめていて　いつものように　やさしい時の中で  
この手握って　見つめて　今だけを

You're everything You're everything  
あなたと離れてる場所でも　会えばきっと許してしまう　どんな夜でも

You're everything You're everything  
あなたの夢見るほど強く　愛せる力を勇気に　今かえていこう

You're everything You're everything  
あなたと離れてる場所でも　会えばいつも消えさって行く　胸の痛みも

You're everything You're everything  
あなたが想うより強く　やさしい嘘ならいらない　欲しいのはあなた

You're everything You're everything  
You're everything  
My everything

I met you by chance in the midst of passing time  
It's amazing, isn't it? That such a miracle should be so close by

Still missing you, the time passes and I can't see you  
Slipping through the door, I remember once again  
You laughing with that person

My beloved, please don't make me sad  
There are nights when I cry myself to sleep  
Don't look at the past, just look at me

You're everything, you're everything  
I'm stronger than you think  
I don't want any kind lies  
All I want is you

How long a time can be called forever?  
I want to go with you far, far into the future  
I want to peek at those days with you

My beloved, please hold me  
Like you always do, in the midst of time's tenderness  
Hold my hand, look just at the present

You're everything, you're everything  
Even if I'm apart from you  
If we could see each other, I'd surely forgive you  
Any night

You're everything, you're everything  
I'm strong enough to dream of you  
Now let's change the power to love  
Into courage

You're everything, you're everything  
Even if I'm apart from you  
If we could see each other, it would all disappear  
Even the pain in my heart

You're everything, you're everything  
I'm stronger than you think  
I don't want any kind lies  
All I want is you  
You're everything…
