Hopefully this is the LAST time I ever need to go to the Internet and find algorithms that will work for my system. Once I got that part down, I'll be extremely happy (since the additional coding work would be purely enhancements ;) ).

I'm thinking of extending my final year project as a hobbyist/pet project once I graduated. Thinking of creating a Parapara game using just a webcam, something like Eyetoy. :)
