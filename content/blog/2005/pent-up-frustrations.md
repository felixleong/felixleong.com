Avoid this at all cost if you don't want to get yourself stirred into this (minor) emotional whirlpool:

It all started by a very minor and small problem when I'm doing my work.

But eventually as I find myself can't even able to get rid of this pest from hindering my work, the frustrations get piled up to a point that I got extremely pissed off about it: The feeling is just like when there's a fly buzzing around you. You know you can swat that fly, but this fly seems to show some cunningness as it avoid and dodges all your offensive attacks. Each and every time you miss it, the fly seems to grow in size, and yet no matter how hard you try, it just seems to find a way to buzz away from your attackâ€¦ even worse, it seems to have fun at it as it flies around you with a sarcastic glee.

And yet the weirder thing is that I can't believe that keep that straight face even though I feel as if I'm some sort like a frustration transmission station internally! (Negative brain waves?)

Anyway, feel much better now. This entry is brought to you by my own emotional repression that can't be controlled any longer.
