Just one statement is enough to trigger thousands of thoughts, flooding the mind with thousands of illusions: those that reflect the core of our own becoming -- desires, regrets, dreams, imagination, repressed emotionsâ€¦

Some beautiful, some not-so, some downright scary and ugly.

Somehow, each and every of these thoughts, screaming attention for one to perceive it as a reality. Is that a manifestion of a vision, so that we will work to achieve that? Or is it just an act of cowardice, seeking an outlet to make believe of something that seemed to be impossible?
