Just went to fill up the job application form today, and I'm just on my first steps in getting the job. Now I need is to send in the required documents, make sure I get my grades right this semester and NOT to screw up for whatever relevant reasons and I'll be sure of getting the job I wanted.

And just a mental note: Don't screw up when you get the job as well, it's definitely going to be good experience down the road ;).

What else, thesis due date tomorrow and I have the final two chapter to type :(. But I do have the materials, hopefully I don't get a writer's block or I'm **IN DEEP TROUBLE.**

What else, yeah! I got move's BOULDER today and all I can say it will rock your socks off :D! A definitely 5/5 in my books ;).
