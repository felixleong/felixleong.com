Today can be described with only a few words: Tall stack of paperwork, pending workload (that keeps on coming my way) and a flat tyre.

But working on my own website shifts my energies back in shape. Just merged all the important posts in my technical blog, [The Digital Blue Wave](http://thedigitalbluewave.felixleong.com/). It's been hard work migrating it over to my personal site, [FelixLeong.com](http://www.felixleong.com/), but now with all the contents moved over, I can spend time working on other stuff.

First things first: Get rid of that default template XD.
