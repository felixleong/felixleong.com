Ever since pawsrpg mentioned about Ys, I have been ploughing my game music MIDI collection back up again. It&apos;s like, it&apos;s been about years that I haven&apos;t listen them through~ and somehow I just feel so like listening to Sound Team JDK again. :)

And just listening to them makes me feel so touched while all the memories and emotions came back to me :&apos;-). It just seems that I&apos;m able to relate back to the songs and characters that I love so much.  Still remember songs like Tina, Forever Rachael (FF6), Feena, To Make The End of Battle (Ys), Tracks of The White Witch (Eiyuu Densetsu 3: Shirokimajo), Red Crimson Drop (Eiyuu Densetsu 4)… There&apos;s just too much to list…

Speaking of which, I have just grabbed a sample of To Make The End of Battle from Falcom JDK BAND album and I&apos;m so swept away! Those guitar works are definitely insane :D, reminds me back that I would want to listen to Guilty Gear X again!

Woo… Till then, I still need to type my thesis :p.
