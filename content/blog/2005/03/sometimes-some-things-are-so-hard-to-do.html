{% mark post -%}Just all of a sudden, some of my sorrows just came back to me. It&apos;s like… ever since I came back to school, these feelings just came back to me. I believe that I have gotten over that stage, but how wrong I am, as I&apos;m still feeling that aching in my heart. I know I still love him a lot (I think the subject of interest is implied), probably I&apos;m just feeling upset of how he responds to me? It&apos;s like… I was given the cold shoulder: so cold that it really pricks my heart.

At times like this I just feel so helpless… as there are just things which is so hard to do. Apart from the fact that I really find it hard to express how I&apos;m feeling now to him, right now I&apos;m just feeling like just prodding whoever in my online friend&apos;s list or my phone book and just send some random SOS signals, asking for help. But just right when I was thinking of doing so, I just held back… Thoughts just floods my brain "It&apos;s not really a big deal actually… you know that you can handle it yourself… not everybody likes to hear some nitty gritty sob story…"

Am I being strong? Or am I just acting to be strong? At times like this, I just wish that I knew where to find warmth and attention… as immature as it seems.{%- endmark %}
