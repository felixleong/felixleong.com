Just got a new graphic card replaced for my PC, so currently my PC is running fine and dandyâ€¦ or maybe not. As I&apos;m trying to install the card into my PC, Windows XP just didn&apos;t feel like cooperating and would never let me install the driver for the graphic card. So I&apos;m like "OK, so probably I&apos;ll do a fresh install" and although that works, I can&apos;t get 1024x768 to work! GAH!!! So now I&apos;m facing a large-ish 800x600 screen (as in the UI stuff instead of UI space).

So now not only I have to find the time to reinstall all the software back into my PC, I also have to deal with the resolution issue. I have downloaded the latest graphic card driver, I really hope that it&apos;ll solve the problem because 800x600 really makes me sad :(.

No Internet for the time being as I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be replacing another 56K modem soon due to my current financial situation. But it&apos;s a good thing as I would really love to take a break from the Internet for a while.

One assignment is due tommorrow together with my combinatronics test O_O". I really hoped that things will go well.
