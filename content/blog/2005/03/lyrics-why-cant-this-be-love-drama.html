Somehow this song just grow in me after several runs of SEB75 and Aerobeat Eurobeat Version 4. Listening it through I do have a love-hate relationship with this song, because it really sounds… cruel.

Personally I find this to remind of a particular relationship I had in the past… thinking about it, it seems that it&apos;s more of a song for people to dedicate to myself  ^^".

<b><u>Why Can&apos;t This Be Love / Drama</u></b>
Why don&apos;t you believe
I say why you don&apos;t believe that I love you
After all I have to pretend to know whatever you&apos;ve got in
And I really wonder
Why I should achieve
I say why I should achieve what I run to
After that you got me started so fast
Nobody can&apos;t stop the race now
And I do wonder wonder

* If you really want to restart the game with me
And explanation of situation is over
You and me

** Why can&apos;t this be love and tell me
Why can&apos;t we go on together
Why can&apos;t this be called affection
Why you keep on tellin&apos; me lies

Why can&apos;t this be love
I say why can&apos;t this be love and affection
Since you know what happened there on the beach
Was more and more than a feeling
And I do wonder wonder

(Repeat *)
(Repeat **)

Damn… Why I kept on flooding my LJ with lyrics XD?

Anyway, still can&apos;t sleep as I was working on my final year project. Honestly I have spent more time fooling around than actually working.

[edit:]
Took this from Paws:
  <table align="center" cellpadding="20"> <tbody><tr> <td align="center"> <font color="black" size="5"><b>Advanced</b></font><br /> You scored 93% Beginner, 93% Intermediate, 87% Advanced,  and 66% Expert! </td> </tr> <tr> <td>

You have an extremely good understanding of beginner, intermediate, and
advanced level commonly confused English words, getting at least 75% of
each of these three levels&apos; questions correct. This is an <b>exceptional</b> score. Remember, these are <i>commonly confused</i> English words, which means most people don&apos;t use them properly. You got an extremely respectable score.

Thank you so much for taking my test. I hope you enjoyed it!

HUH?! Personally I find the test a bit too easy… But then again, probably I was wrong because I DID score low for the expert level. Hmm… But at least I should have scored better compared to my peers. *evil grins >=P* (and I&apos;m proud to have a great command of English :p)
