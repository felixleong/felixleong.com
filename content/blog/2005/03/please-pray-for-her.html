Grandma Kiew has been hospitalised today, currently she&apos;s in the HDU (high dependency unit, whatever that is). And by the looks and description from my aunt, her situation is a bit worrying. I&apos;m not sure what will happen to her, but I did noticed that for the past few days she isn&apos;t feeling that well.

I&apos;m not too sure about the seriousness of her conditionâ€¦ but then I&apos;m concerned. So for those who are reading this, please pray for her safety and hope she&apos;ll be OK.
