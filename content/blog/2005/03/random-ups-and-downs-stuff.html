Let&apos;s see what we had for today…

My sister fared great in her STPM (1 A, 1 B+ and 2 Bs), congrats for that ^^. So probably she won&apos;t be having much problem in applying for some good courses in some good local universities ^^. As for myself, I did pretty badly on my combinatronics quiz :(. Bleh. Donated blood as well, but it seems that my health does take a toll after all this stress, unstable sleep cycle and other health related issues. So it&apos;s like most of the time I just feel dizzy and slightly nauseated. Guess it needs another few more hours to recover.

Apart from that, I do need some time to work on my thesis as it&apos;ll be dued this Friday. But it seems that I&apos;m doing more talk/rant than actually doing it >.<".

Bleh… Just don&apos;t know, I&apos;m just in the fit of having confusing thoughts and feelings at the moment.

[Edit: Oh yeah, forget to mention, I still need to get a form filled for the job this Thursday. Wish me luck on getting the job! ^^]
