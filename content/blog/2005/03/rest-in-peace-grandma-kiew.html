The bad news came this morning, Grandma Kiew has passed away this morning at around 11. It&apos;s really sad to hear that… As now the living room would be empty most of the time… She&apos;s been here ever since the first day I stayed with my aunt, and it&apos;s really hard to see her go to another place.

Rest in peace, Grandma Kiew. You&apos;ll always be remembered :(.

In a much lighter note, my SEB presents J-Euro Original Collection (Vol.1) came in today, so this will be my CD collection up until now (which I don&apos;t plan to expand for some time, probably 3 months or so):

And this my current JPop CD collection to date:

Now I really scare myself, seeing how scary my spending habits were. XD So eBay would take a cold seat for a good 3 months :)… If I have enough will power, anyway :p. But I do my best to keep this promise.
