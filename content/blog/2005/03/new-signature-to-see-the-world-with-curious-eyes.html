More often than not, these signatures really reflect on my current situations and thoughts :). So I guess it&apos;s time for a new signature ^^.

I&apos;m reverting to the smaller format which I used to use over RPGamer&apos;s forums (250 x 75 pixels). It&apos;s basically hard work to cram a lot of things inside it, but I do find it appealing ^^.

For some reasons though, I just find the signature a bitâ€¦ well, glaring, sort make me hard to see my signature properly without looking away from my monitor from time to time ^^". Probably it&apos;s because of the extremely clashing blue (but then I really wanted the shade of blue there) or the very bright red I used. Ah~ Probably if that&apos;s really the case I&apos;ll change a new one pretty shortly ^^".
