{% mark post -%}Ever happen to you that there&apos;s sometimes that you feel that you&apos;re detached from the actual community that you are in, but then again, it&apos;s not completely so? I don&apos;t know, that how I feel exactly after I came back for school after the 2-3 week haitus. It&apos;s like, when I mix with people, I just find myself in some sort of an awkward situation where even when I&apos;m talking to close friends, I just feel like I&apos;m talking with somebody that I only knew recently, or vice versa (as in I feel like they are chattting with me like I&apos;m a different person).

It&apos;s kinda funny though, is it that I have changed? Or is it the environment and the people have changed, and I didn&apos;t keep myself updated with it? I don&apos;t really know about the former (probably I have changed in many minor aspects), but I did notice a lot of the latter.

Sometimes I just seem to recall that some people commented that I&apos;m living my life as if I&apos;m living in my own world. Honestly up until now I don&apos;t think I really understand what that meant. Probably it implies that my way of thinking and conduct is a little bit… umm, unique? Or does that it implies that I&apos;m a bit over self-centred? Or is it that sometimes that I always spend time on working on my thoughts and ideals that my perception of reality isn&apos;t close to what reality really is? But then again, by what we define reality? Social norms and values? Or is it something else?

…

Anyway, I guess that&apos;s something that I would need to work out for myself. But I&apos;m glad that I&apos;m still among with people and they acknowledge my presence.

… Another month and my university life will end. Somehow I&apos;ve mixed thoughts about this, as much as I don&apos;t understand what I&apos;m feeling now. It&apos;s like… I&apos;ll be entering another phase in life, and it just seems that I&apos;m sensing another major change in myself which I&apos;m unable to predict.

… Guess time will tell.
