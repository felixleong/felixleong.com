Hmm… not much of actual content I would want to post here. Well… considering life these days are so jammed pack with school stuff that I have no time left for a breather. Did somewhat having a headache while trying to catch on with the current progress of classes, which I have been missing out during the past two weeks.

Speaking of which, I don&apos;t know… but I just can&apos;t stop but feeling angry over someone for no real reason. Probably it&apos;s due to the recent perception I had for that person, but honestly speaking I don&apos;t want to do any judgement emotionally so I&apos;ll just try my best to keep my cool at the moment.

Currently bidding on Maharaja Hi-NRG Night Revolution Vol.9. Although I want that album REALLY badly, but I&apos;m not putting high hopes on it considering how Maharaja albums always sell like hot cakes over eBay. But hopefully I can get it since it has two of my favourite songs on it :).

Guess that&apos;s pretty much wraps up my day. Just something random: Current emotional index: flat.
