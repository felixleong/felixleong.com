It&apos;s been quite some time I have been at home, rushing on assignments and my own final year project. It&apos;s kinda funny thinking about it though, seeing myself being in the last month of university life, probably I should have at school, enjoying the last moments to be with my classmates. But so it seems that my works seems to take a much higher priority… but I only have myself to blame for procrastinating work.

Looking back into those two years, it&apos;s like… a lot of things had happened, and I have been through all the most extreme ups and downs that I had in life. And now I&apos;m just sitting here, feeling a sense of calmness which I would never expect. It&apos;s like, if I were to be a situation like now in the past, I would probably freak out and started to panic. But today&apos;s a totally different story, it&apos;s like… I&apos;m sitting here, feeling so cool and calm like I&apos;m not concerned whether I would flunk in my examinations, missed the most important deadlines or perhaps at a larger scale, whether I may not graduate. But am I really not concerned? Hell no, knowing how much of a perfectionist I am.

But the kind of calmness today is just so… different than what I would use to react. It&apos;s really kind of strange actually, but I really liked it this way, despite my worries of the sudden change of behaviour. Is it that I&apos;m letting my grip a little loose? Or is it something else? Well… probably the reason why I speculate that it might be something else is because the calming experience just feels like one of those spiritual experiences. :)

Hmm… maybe I shouldn&apos;t waste too much time on this, got a thesis to finish by tomorrow!
