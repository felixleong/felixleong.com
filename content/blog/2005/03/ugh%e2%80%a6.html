I hate feeling sick :(.

I got the flu yesterday. Now perhaps it wasn&apos;t a big deal, but the reason I hate it is because it&apos;s much more of an annual serious sickness, and the agony I felt isn&apos;t funny: I feel like my body, especially the joints feels so painful as if I have been into a torture chamber. And to make matters worse, all sorts of scary images and the worst things that I don&apos;t want to see seems to flash into my brain non-stop.

And all this lasts for about 10 hours and the whole day I feel so weak that I can&apos;t even budge to move at all. Thank god I&apos;m feeling slightly better now, but I&apos;m still feeling weak. Hopefully I&apos;ll recover in no time.

On a lighter note, Norma Sheffield&apos;s Sweet Heaven album is in my mail today :). And it&apos;s such a great CD <333.
