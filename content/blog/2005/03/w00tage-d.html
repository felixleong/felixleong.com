Domino&apos;s 1, 2, Santos is definitely yummy :D! Although it took me some painstaking hours to get it encoded into MP3 without having it sound muffled D:. Anyway, for those who are interested, just grab <a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/">dbpowerAMP Music Convertor</a> (freeware) and use the dMC Auxiliary Input program that comes with it. This software saved me from more agony (I&apos;m using a lame wave recorder before that).

Anyway, it&apos;s really worth the 210yen ;), for those who are interested can go to <a href="http://atmusic.avexnet.or.jp/wma/index.asp">@Music</a> and have a look. (It&apos;s in Japanese, BTW)

I&apos;m grabbing Wild Reputation 2005 (Grand Mix) now, and I&apos;m going to pay for it tomorrow (since my bank made a restriction that I can only make 1 online shopping transaction per day). And I&apos;m sure that it&apos;s going to be good :D.

[sidenote: OH GAWD! Princess F&apos;s Shadows In The Night (Extended Version) is there too <333. I think I better resist from buying that one ;p. Probably I&apos;m better off waiting for Eurobeat Flash show up in eBay.]
