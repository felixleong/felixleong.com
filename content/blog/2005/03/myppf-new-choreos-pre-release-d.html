Yay! The filming goes extremely well ^^v.It&apos;s like, I&apos;m getting better at adjusting my camera and stuff. (Yay for self-filmed para videos which DOESN&apos;T suck XDDD)

Originally I&apos;m planning to ask Phil to do the video editing, but as it turns out I got a bunch of LARGE files (200MB-ish) which will probably take me ages to upload them over a server on dialup (or even my school&apos;s Internet, which is pretty sluggish lately) >.<". Boo ;____;, I want broadband… NOW!

Anyway, I did do some simple editing, just to make them look a little bit nicer. Somehow it just turns out that it looks very similar to the videos to PPN XDDD. Oops! :p

Anyway, 4 spanking new choreographs is ready for uploading. I think I&apos;ll be uploading them tomorrow at school, at least the small WMVs. But as a special surprise, I&apos;m throwing one in as a pre-release ^^. OK, maybe not, just want to get some feedback on the -Experimental Groove- version. As mentioned previously, I have been thinking of new ideas to incorporate in my choreography and I&apos;m trying to make some of these dance which really deviates from my usual style (aside from the "Easy to learn" philosophy). So this is my first MYPPF-EG dance:

(Ahmed, I know you want this ;) ).
[*note: I do noticed that the hands get cut off on the top sometimes during the sabi, but probably you&apos;ll able to make the moves out since I don&apos;t feel like re-film them under the scorching sun >.<]

Just to add on, I wore my Fire and Ice style clothes for filming ;). And I do have other surprises for my other videos ^^b. So hope you enjoy it… and stay tune for the actual release! :D
