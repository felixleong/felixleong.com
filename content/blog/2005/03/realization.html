{% mark post -%}梦醒之后，才发现你以前给我的那毫无防备的微笑。这时才猛然发觉…我爱你的，就是你那一份纯真。

For the past few days, it has been raining continuously . It&apos;s pretty relaxing to see the rain drops while having my thoughts wandering around… As if to see my thoughts dancing around with the rain drops, cleansing them during the process. I just have that sensation of realization at some point for different things, however it is as seems that I had the answers without knowing how I reach to that conclusion.

In other news, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be expecting an eventful day today as I&apos;m spending time at home working on assignments (if procrastination doesn&apos;t kicks in, that is).{%- endmark %}
