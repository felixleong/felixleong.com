There were times when you just have to accept the fact that some wounds would take a longer time to heal.

I really don&apos;t know whether I should wish for another special person to enter my life (edit: not necessarily of a romantic relationship), or to hope that my wounds would heal sooner.

I guess either way would be good ;_;.
