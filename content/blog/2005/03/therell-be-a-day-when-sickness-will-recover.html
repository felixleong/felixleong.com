{% mark post -%}My throat&apos;s feeling much better now, and I&apos;m starting to get used to the cough syrup. It still cause slight drowsiness, but at least it didn&apos;t induce a headache now.

Yesterday I have been spending time ranting about my sickness to some of my IM friends ^^". Well… I suppose I&apos;m just seeking attention ^^". But when I said something like "First emotional sickness, now physical sickness, what&apos;s next" to Steven, his reply was just a simple word: "recover".

… Guess I just need a little time to heal completely: emotionally and physically, till then, all I need is some good medicine, some rest and caring people :). Thanks for the well wishes! ^^{%- endmark %}
