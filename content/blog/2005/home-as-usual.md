Yes I'm safely at home now, enjoying the warmth and relaxation back at home :). Probably I'm lucky enough to have several homes, but the one that I have live in for almost two decades is always the most special and important to me. Guess I'm just lucky enough to have my parents.

I think I'll be going out today, it's been a while since I last went to Ipoh. Let's see whether there's any one paraing there, kinda miss the physical exercise that I have been missing for the past few weeks.
