心中的彷徨失措，有谁能够体会到？是孤寂在作祟吗？还是自己害怕心中被压抑的黑暗面？

梦醒时分，只是感觉到自己身上的冷汗，自己迅速的喘气声。

The helpless feeling of aimlessness, can anybody understand what I'm feeling right now? Is it caused by loneliness? Or is it that I'm afraid of the darker side of me which has been suppressed until now?

By the time I woke up from my dream, I can only feel the cold sweat on my body, and my fast, panting voice.
