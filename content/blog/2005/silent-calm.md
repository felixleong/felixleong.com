(Note: Yes, I know the subject sounds funny, but since calm can be used as a noun… :p)

Let's see…

Feeling kinda silly these days, my emotions gets into a really fluctuating ground as I review the relationship concept. I don't know how to say it really… the experience is completely different, as I'm more actively participating in the communication process, I guess. It's still a damn bumpy ride, and I definitely have a good reason to feel shaky: because I really can't see from which grounds I can really evaluate my progress and… nothing's guaranteed in this attempt. There's a possibility that I'll end up back in square one or further back… but then again, I guess it might not be that scary as I have been through them before.

In other news, been into a shopping spree during the weekends. Bought *yet* another book on Japanese, and Life Mysteries from Osho. Then today I just grabbed Koda Kumi's Best ~first things~. Haven't get it spinning yet, but from a few first tracks impression, I'm pretty sure that I'd like it a lot :D.
