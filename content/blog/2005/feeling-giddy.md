Learnt a new word today when I browse through the LJ mood list:

**Giddy [adj]**

1. Having or causing a whirling sensation; liable to falling
2. Lacking seriousness; given to frivolity

The first one would definitely fit what I'm feeling right now, because it seems that I didn't get a good nap as well as the electrical surges are making the lights flicker. Ouch… >.<

Anyway, duh… dizziness… @\_@…

Just some sidenotes… as much as I really liked my new look, somewhat all of a sudden I just feels that it didn't suit me. Well… It's not that I don't like it, in fact I really love the look because I really like the fact that it shows out my confident self. Just that I really don't know what happened which triggers this feeling… But what I do know is that… somewhat I'm feeling a bit down… ah, nevermind… been really missing my crushes desparately ;\_\_\_;. [:: edit :: Looking at it a few minutes later, I guess I'm just being a little bit emotional, that's all. ;)]

Anyway, I think Bean is coming over later… Honestly I don't know what to respond to this… because many thoughts and memories seems to flood back to me…

Getting my glasses tommorrow, by the way. Will snap photos ;).

[p/s: Will post my April 2004 review when I'm feeling better. Bleargh…]
