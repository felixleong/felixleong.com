And so I just reached home.

Qing Ming is pretty smooth and sunny yesterday :), but sunny might be the negative part of things as it's blazing hot out there without any shades from anything on top of my head :p. Then I have to go back home as I do have classes today :(. But at least on the way with aunt Ling and uncle Vincent has been pretty fun :), for one thing I get to know Terrance better and got to continue (and finish) watching Initial D Third Stage The Movie. <3 And I'm really excited to get to know more friends better along the way (which includes my team mates for my virtual reality assignment).

The second news is that now I'll be having two roommates as two of my friends, Steven and Ting Gee, moved into my room :) (Some of you might recall that Steven is my best friend from college). Just a mention, Ting Gee used to be my course mate from college for one semester, and I didn't keep in touch with him after he got a offer from a public university at that time. As much that means that I have less private space now, but at least I won't be that lonely at night.

What elseâ€¦ Oh yeah, just got a Japanese personal word processor from my mom's friend, Ms Chee :). It's basically an electronic typewriter combined with a dot matrix printer, and it sports a Japanese keyboard. I haven't got my hands on it as I still need a electrical output convertor for it. But it's going to be really fun with it. And Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks definitely rocks <333.

And I finally managed to save my personal data which I have lost :). Yay, so that's good news for me.

Just an announcement, I decided to pull myself off from the Internet for a full two weeks apart from updating my LJ. There's a few reasons to it: I have not much money to buy a brand new modem, as well as giving myself some time to readjust myself and understand my own emotions (positive or not).

Guess that's pretty much it. While I'm typing this entry, I'm still rendering my virtual reality assignment, which my team will be presenting tomorrow. Will post the final video up later :).
