Finally I reach home after a really bad traffic jam along the way.

Well… seeing this, I finally get some time to actually update my LJ a bit. There's quite a lot of things happening this Chinese New Year, and it's really a good one for me :). Lots of funs and laughs during the celebration, and being with my family and friends are always enjoyable.

First things first, my new look does got a lot of attention. And almost every single person who had seen me got a extremely big surprise and just seeing the looks of their face is pretty interesting XD. But pretty much the feedback is extremely positive and it's really a plus in my books ^\_^b.

Then the rest of the days are pretty much… well… full of gathering with friends, especially when I haven't seen them for more than one year. It's really great to see back all my best friends back in my hometown: Kang Jun, Jane, Kar Yee, See Kai, Chuen Wei and George. And of course, being with them means that there's always be endless rounds of Mahjong ^^. And all I can say that I'm not only getting better at it, the worse part is that I think I'm getting addicted to it XD. But I pretty much only get the chance to play once a year so that's OK. Despite the fact that we do, in a way, gamble, but the wager is pretty minimal (by the cents) and everyone basically just joined because it's fun playing Mahjong together.

But I did get my mom worried because I always ended up going home extremely early in the morning XD.

Other than that, well… not every single moment is extremely happy. There are times when I do feel extremely lonely back at home, and seemingly the CODS has not completely healed. But… well, guess it takes some time.

Anyway, since I'm back here in my aunt house now, that pretty much means that I'll be online more often and my LJ daily update will return as usual :). Besides, there're quite a lot of drifting thoughts which I would really love to share lately ;).

Catch you guys later!

[p/s: Hmm… been away from cyber space is always overwhelming… I guess I'll catch up as much friend's entry as I could manage ;) ]
