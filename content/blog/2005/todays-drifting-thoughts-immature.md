1. 开始发现自己那不成熟的那一面…原来一向来都只是逞强。这时才发现自己不知不觉地为自己画上了浓妆。

    是掩饰自己的脆弱吗…？还是太过在乎你们的看法…？

2. 在接电话的当时，仿佛听到自己那木讷无神的声音。旧伤复发的我，开始对身边的一切觉得了麻木…

    在电话线另一端的你，是否是为我担心呢？现在的我，在使出一百二十分的力气，心中的那份沉重却让我无法发挥我以往的那份热诚。

    …真的是很对不起，我会继续努力，去恢复那失去了的精神，好不让你太过担心。

3. 此时此刻，想要脱掉脸上的尘埃…用最真诚的心去面对一切。

4. 在星空底下，我才发觉我又只是一个人了…


1. I'm starting to notice the immature side of me… suddenly I notice that all the while I have been trying to hard. At this moment of time, I only realise that I have put up a thick layer of makeup on my face.

    Is it that I'm hiding my weakness…? Or is it that I'm overly concern about your point of view…?

2. When I picked up the phone, I feel as if I heard my soulless voice. Having the old hurts coming back to me, I'm starting to feel indifferent to the things around me…

    On the other side of the line, are you still worrying about me? The person I am now, even after using up 120% of my energies, that heavy burden in my heart have dragged me down that I can't express the same enthusiasm that I had before.

… I really feel sorry, I'll continue to work hard, to recover all the spirit that I have lost, so that I don't have to make you too worried about me.

3. At this moment of time, I really wanted to remove all the dust on my face… use the most sincere heart to face everything around me.

4. Under the starry skies, I noticed that I'm alone again…
