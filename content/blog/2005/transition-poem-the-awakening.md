### Chapter 3: May'05

Time passes  
As I am watching  
The ebb and flow of life

At times of constant change  
I still know deep down  
That what's deep and true will always stay

Horizons broaden when I seek  
Wisdom accumulated when I understand  
Happiness blooms when I appreciate

As my story continues to unfold  
I will continue my dance and song  
As I continue wander around my life journey

### Chapter 4 -- The Awakening  

*December 2005*

Deep asleep…  
All this while  
I was hushed gently  
that it's time to wake up

Never easy  
To open up  
My whole being trembling  
Knowing everything will change completely

It's never  
An easy journey  
Where hope and pain  
Intertwined together as one entity

Finally realised  
How to live…  
That I can't be  
Staying in the dark forever

Slowly approaching  
My eyes opening…  
This is my awakening  
With my eyes watching attentively

Appreciating all experiences that enriches my being…

*~ Continuously, to seek, to understand and to appreciate:  
It's an endless pilgrimage  
towards the ultimate goal.  
Forever… Together…~*
