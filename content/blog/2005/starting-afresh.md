Nothing much happening these days, just me with the same workload (umm… me being workaholic?).

Been spending some time doing some computer spring cleaning, considering how cripple my WindowsXP has become after having myself screwing up my computer settings :p. Somehow it's kind of a soothing experience seeing that the computer is being setup in an ideal environment with no clutter at all. But seriously I do need to do the same to my data partition with all my MP3, videos, photographs and other junk :p.

Installed Fedora Core 4 (Linux) as well :). I seriously thinking of converting to Linux as my main OS, the only thing now is that before that is being realised, I have to setup tons of stuff… some as basic as getting my modem installed and getting my Internet connection running. I think that's going to take me some time…

Looking forward to next week. :) Got almost the whole week off due to Deepavali (Tuesday) and Hari Raya (or more commonly known as Eid-ul-Fitr in the Arabian countries, which is expected to be celebrated on Thursday and Friday) holidays. Considering that the company declared Wednesday as a compulsary leave, it became one of those rare occurence when I only have a one day work week :p.

Apart from that, Sze Hau and Sook Lan will be back as well and I'll be going to Port Dickson with my office friends on Thursday! :D That's definitely going to be fun :D.

In other news, I'm also starting my work on my FelixLeong.com website. I'm thinking of working on my ParaGroove website first, considering that it's much less work than the others. Not to mention that I really want to ride on the Para wave as well :D.

Wow… thinking of the things that I need to do can be pretty exciting as well :).
