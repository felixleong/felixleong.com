It's been months that I have a certain kind of feeling unknown to me… a feeling of certain discord seems to be bugging me for quite some time. I couldn't really tell the actual reason actually… Is it that the past feelings still has its trace? Or is it that a feeling that get suppressed in me? Or is it that my perfectionism isn't really tolerating my performance lag…? Or is it a fear towards something…?

Honestly it wasn't really a big deal that actually bring me any hindrance towards my progress, but… I do wish that I can do something good about it instead of having myself being bothered by it….

Anyway, in a more exciting note, just received my first set of Ayu singles in the mail! :D Basically it was sold in a set of four when I bid on it at eBay, and truth to be told I'm no big fan of buying singles (albums worth much more in my own opinion), but the only reason I got it is because there's one single that I wanted so badly. :p (For those who know me good enough should know which one it is, it can't be anywhere from being less obvious ;p)

So now I can sing along with the instrumental version of Ayu's songs <3<3<3!

And yeah! Someone in my office got his braces off and he is getting hotter than ever :D! I wonder whether I would want my teeth braced up… Hmm… :)
