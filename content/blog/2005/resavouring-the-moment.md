*"Hello sunshine!"*

Nothing much yesterday except for some minor mood swings and lots of sleep :).

Learnt the para for Red Hot Zip / Dave & Domino and Kill The Silence / Domino, which means that Parapara Paradise 2 mission completed! :D Now I just need to perfect the dances and proceed to the third volume (Golden Eurobeat oldies goodness! <3<3<3).

I also dug up my Ayu album collection and read through all the lyrics all over again, savouring all the deep meanings, memories and feelings that I had for each of her self-composed lyrics :).

Then this morning I just feel like taking a lot pictures along the path to work :). And I do have a lot of good shots to share. I'll post them later :). (Hope the telephone line is working when I reach home :) )
