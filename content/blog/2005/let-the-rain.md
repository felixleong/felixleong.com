嫌いんです！今のお天気がとても悪いだって、僕の全身は湿りました。

(I really hate this! The weather now is extremely bad now, that my whole body is getting wet.) << I don't think my translation is correct, but then again, I'm much more unsure whether my Japanese I correct either :p. Anyone kind enough to help?

[p/s: should the use of から　(because) would be better here?]

Anyway, just for some reasons today is extremely happening. During the afternoon at class, there's an extremely bad electrical breakdown in town which lasted about an hour or two, then later on it rained extremely badly on my way home just now >.<".

Other than that, things are pretty good, except that I'm feeling a bit wet now.

Anyway, Guess who is having his birthday today? :3 HAPPY BIRTHDAY PHIL (aka Phil) :D!!! Hope you'll get to see more Domino in SEB in your big 2-O's. :D

OK, back to work now!

[:: update ::]

HOT DAMN! I didn't notice that [PPStage](http://www.paraparastage.com/) is already up with the stuff… well, at least the videos section XD (Under Working Material > Visual Mixes > Paralist Routines). It did have some of my videos up there, so do check them out if you haven't ^^. Probably would submit a few of my better original routines to P-chan later on ^^.
