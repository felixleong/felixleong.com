Ugh… preparing for my last paper (Parallel processing) tomorrow isn't really fun at all as I find my head spinning when I go through all the lecture slides. Been seeing imaginary planetary orbits from the beginning until now. I really don't know how's the outcome for tomorrow's paper, I'm really worried that I can't get good grades for this one (since I got a lot of marks for my assignments).

Just to recap, yesterday is pretty fun as Steven, Jacob, Theen Gee and his girlfriend and I went out together. As usual with any outing with Steven, there's always karaoke :). And boy that was fun as I attempted to sing Ayu's songs there :). It's would be great if they had ANGEL'S SONG and GAME, but well, at least they do have M :). It just came to me that M really sang my heart out.

Then we went to Border's, which just opened a few days ago. And boy I just love the book selections and the atmosphere :). It's definitely going to be one of my favourite hangout place in the future :). Currently there's quite a lot of books and stuff that I wanted there, but looking at my current financial situation… well, probably I might get them some time later :).

And one thing that really can't forgive Steven is that he (together with Theen Gee and his girlfriend) have left me and Jacob at Border's while they went somewhere else! Grr… but it's not really a bad thing either, been spending some time catching up news and stuff, and it is really fun going out with Jacob :). Just have to remind me of my college days.

OK, I better stop here now and get my head spinning all over again!
