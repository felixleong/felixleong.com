OK, the title has **nothing** to do with my emotional state, but I was literally describing the weather today as the wind blows really strong today this afternoon. It almost seems like a typhoon is coming as the violent gush of cold wind blows through any opening window that it can enter. Although it wasn't as strong to the point of blowing anything flying around the place, but the cold is greatly unbearable that I have to go to my room with all my windows shut tight.

As for my dayâ€¦ well, things are a little bit unproductive, but it's pretty good for a time when I'm feeling slightly tired throughout the day. And by any chance, tomorrow's another day :).
