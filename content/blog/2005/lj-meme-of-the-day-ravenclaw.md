Hmm… from my memory somehow it does seem that Ravenclaw seem to get the least mention in the books. Hmm… probably geeks are less interesting to talk about :p?

I really wanted to be in Grffindor though, but ah well :p.

Nothing much to say about yesterday, just one of those simple days with a good mood :). Nothing much to do at work, so I'm currently reading up the books which is stored in the shelf in my department :).
