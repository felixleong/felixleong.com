{% mark post -%}Been spending the whole day yesterday getting things to work in Linux. Currently it can access to the Internet, playing my DVDs and MP3s, as well as doing most stuff that I can think of at the moment.

To describe the whole experience, well… it really reminds me of those Windows 95 days when I want to do anything beyond what it is intended to do. But it's not that hard once you got the hang of it.

Hmm… Still working on getting everything installed. :) Probably by then, I'd become a Linux convert? :p{%- endmark %}
