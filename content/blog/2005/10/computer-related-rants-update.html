As mentioned, the combo drive is picky with what it reads. The good news is that I accidentally found out that it is pretty sensitive to the beginning tracks of the CD (for non-techie people, it means the inner circle of the CD), so a quick wipe or two pretty much solves the problem :).

Yay for that! :D

In other news, I reformatted my PC after having myself screwing up the whole system a few months ago. Still in the process of installing stuff. Probably that would take me about a week or two.
