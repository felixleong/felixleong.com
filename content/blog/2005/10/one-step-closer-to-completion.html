Almost got the final, finishing touches to get all my needed software installed. Then my Linux system will be as good as my Windows system :).

Bwee~ This is exciting :), I'm bi-OS-literate :p.

Anyway, still pretty indecisive whether I should buy myself a notebook hard drive portable casing, a drawing tablet, an SEB CD that I wanted or a webhosting package. It's really hard to decide because I had a notebook hard drive lying around piling dust (ever since my notebook died last year), I always wanted a graphic tablet so that I can do more computer art, my Eurobeat obsession needs to be fulfilled (Hah! Sucker!) and I wanted to host my future site up.

Hmm… priorities, priorities…

But anyway, probably I might get a webhost this month, and see whether I have enough financial room to buy another thing that I wanted. :)
