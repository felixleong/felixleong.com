Let's see…

Getting some computer stuff today, a replacement USB cable for my card reader and one stack of CDRs. And the biggest frustration is that my card reader doesn't like the new cable I bought, and my combo drive refuses to recognise the CDRs I bought! p(&gt;_&lt;)q

Argh!!!!

Luckily that the replacement cable I bought is one of those multi-purpose USB cables that you can fit different connectors to connect to different devices. Apparently plugging the card reader directly to the connector works. So that's a good thing. Still checking out whether there's a firmware upgrade for my combo drive… (*update: No, it still doesn't work, but apparently my combo drive is really picky on what it reads… ._.)

Gah… It does seems that I always have problems when I shop for anything related to computers. Bleh… ._.

What's worse is that I'm feeling emotionally sick the whole day -- Just feel as if I'm having a mental throw up. Does seems that the ton of junk I had in my head is really hitting me badly. Somehow I wished that there were actually "medicines" for that, but I guess the only way for it to heal is to let it heal naturally. ;___;

I guess that probably need a few days. But as far as I'm concerned, I'm sure that it will not affect my personal life… Just one of those occasional mood swings. Just that I definitely need some rest, I guess.

*Sigh*
