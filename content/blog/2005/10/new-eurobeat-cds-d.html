Valentina's Your Love and Sophie's Stop The Music CD came into the mail :D, which makes me about 2 titles short from collecting the full album of my favourite artists: Mega NRG Man's Fire and King & Queen's Season.

Still waiting for my SEB130 to come from HMV, Hong Kong :D.

As a possibly related note, it's shawaazu's birthday! Happy birthday! :D
