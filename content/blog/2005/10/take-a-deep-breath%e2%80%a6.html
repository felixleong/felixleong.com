I feel so under-prepared for tommorrow's task. As much as I have finished writing the testing procedures that I have to go through tommorrow, I still feel that it's not complete enough.

And somehow I'm feeling kinda scared actually: going to work somewhere outside the office and staying there for several days (although I'm a bit relieved that another colleague will be accompanying me) and thinking of the seriousness of the task itself (I really hate the thought of myself screwing up this task).

The boss did reassured me that it's not really a life-and-dead issue (the only thing he told me is that to make really sure of is that the slot machine does not cause financial problems to the company), and I was given continuous encouragement by Seng Yaw, my office friend who is usually in charge of this kind of system. But still I'm feeling very nervous -- mainly because I really hate to disappoint them.

Not to mention the amount of task once I reach home later: packing bags, ironing my shirts, making sure that I have all the cables and chargers…

Gah! I'm still worrying that my testing procedure is not complete enough!!! @_@||

OK now… relax… Take a deep breath…
