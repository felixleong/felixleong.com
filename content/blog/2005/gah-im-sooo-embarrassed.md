Up until now I have broke almost one gazillion minor rules (including the most damaging "No Sleeping (not snooze or nap, mind you) in the office" rule and I only knew that I was caught almost every single time but been forgiven every single timeâ€¦ even by the boss O\_O".

Saying so, I just have to be grateful that I have such a friendly environment to work in. And I have to make sure that I didn't take that for granted.

Anyway, off to work now!

(p/s: I might as well plan something that will keep me awake at least 99% of the working time, if not 100%)
