Happy birthday, P-Chan~~~!!! :D

Somehow I dyed my hair back to a darker brown. I did tried to take pictures but due to my recent sickness and stuff, I didn't look great in them ^^". I'll take some when I feel much more healthier.

Will be spending days at home working on my thesis and do some finalizing programming to my system. Wish me luck!
