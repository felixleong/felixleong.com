My friend, Kok Weng, got called in for the second phase of the interview test in my department today, I would really like to congratulate him for making this far and I'm really happy and proud of him :). I really wish him the best of luck! ;)

My friend, Raymond (and probably Alvin as well), left for Penang yesterday. Hopefully they will be treated well there, as (if I'm not wrong) they left their own homes for the very first time. I hope for the best in their first job as well as a great stay over there.

And as for Choon Hui… I'm really glad that he's kick starting his own plans in furthering his studies, and he's currently working on with his IELTS (so that he can study overseas). I'm really glad to see that he's on his way to achieve excellence, and I sincerely hope that he'll be able to achieve the best in life.

As for myself, well… my research project is almost done, will be handing it in tomorrow, although I'm not really satisfied with what I did. That gives a good call for me to say goodbye to my own burdens that I have been holding and get my gears all pumped up for the upcoming adventures that awaits me.

I guess I wish myself luck for that too ;).

[:: Edit: Oh gosh I'm just so glad to fix those punctuation nuisances :p ::]
