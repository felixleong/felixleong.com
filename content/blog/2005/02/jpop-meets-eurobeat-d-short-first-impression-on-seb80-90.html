Wooo~ I&apos;m loving my SEB80 and 90 <333. Now THAT&apos;S what I call a awesome non-stop remix CD :D. Really, listening through SEB80 and 90 is definitely a blast and now SEB110 and 120 seems more to me like a "been there, done that" attempt :p.

I really liked how they did put in a lot of sound remix effects and some Eurobeat parody into the mix. A very memorable one is definitely how DJ Shu did the effects for Hot Love and Emotion / Virginelle, it&apos;s like, the entering transitions uses some of the most memorable Virginelle songs and it goes like "Kiss Me Kiss Me Babe, Why Not, Mystery of Love, Don&apos;t You Love Me, Every girl is giving too~~ (sabi ending for Hot Love and Emotion)", and later on in the A-melo, DJ Shu creatively put in snipplets of Don&apos;t You Love Me and Lucky Lucky into the ending of every verse. :D Now that&apos;s what I call creative :D.

It&apos;s really hard to describe how cool these CDs were and I would say that it is a must have for all Eurobeat collectors :).

And the cooler part is that SEB80 & 90 each came with a small CD which contains… Covers of JPop tunes! :D I mean, how often do we get to listen Eurobeat singers singing to JPop? And they are really impressively done *ish touched*.

Let&apos;s see, the list goes:

<b>SEB80</b>:
1. Boy Meet Girl / Domino (trf),
2. Body feels EXIT / Virginelle (Namie Amuro),
3. Feel Like dance / Cherry (globe),
4. EZ DO DANCE / Helena (trf)

<b>SEB90</b>:
1. Feel My Heart / Domino (Every Little Thing),
2. Dear My Friend / Cherry (Every Little Thing),
3. Future world / Helena (Every Little Thing),
4. Go To The Top / Dave Rodger (New tune)

And unlike J-Euro covers, these songs are really a blast. :D You just have to listen to them to know how good they were :D. Out of all of them, I like Body feels EXIT / Virginelle and Feel My Heart / Domino the best :).

Speaking of Feel My Heart… this song really touches me, thanks to Domino&apos;s powerful vocal and the meaningful lyrics as well. Somehow I think I&apos;ll venture into Every Little Thing someday :).

I think I&apos;ll stop here now. ;)

[p/s: I&apos;m currently bidding on Domino&apos;s CD. Damn I think I&apos;m starting to get addicted to Domino already XDDDD.]
