Just feeling so tired <strike>today</strike> yesterday that I spent most of the time sleeping. Not feeling really top notch physically, in fact I feel extremely sickly/sluggish. T^T

And somehow there&apos;s a lot of things that I wanted to buy. I was introduced to <a href="http://www.clubjapan.jp/">ClubJapan</a> which is pretty awesome because it has free shipping with 5% handling fees, which is far cheaper than the likes of CDJapan and HMV. The catch? Everything is in Japanese and I&apos;m almost struggling because my Japanese skills are pretty limited. But somehow I manage to wade through the procedures and tried to buy PPP6 & 7 soundtracks from that site. Hopefully it&apos;ll be a smooth transaction.

There&apos;s just too much things I would want to buy… But anyway, I&apos;ll be meeting up with William tommorrow to invest in some unit trusts. Probably this will mark the start of my financial planning ;).

If anyone&apos;s wondering why a LJ entry at 3 in the morning… I just slept ^^".

Oh yeah! Happy birthday to girljinbink! ^o^
