After tons of coke, water and rest, finally I feel much more healthier now. The only thing is that I&apos;m still having the sore throat, so probably I need more water to get that fixed.

Tommorrow&apos;s my combinatronics mid-term. Still struggling with it.

[p/s: Speaking of eBay, somehow I did notice there&apos;s a CD series from Spain named "I Love Disco Diamonds". From what I have search through online, it seems to contain a lot of the lesser know italo-disco and Eurobeat tracks. Hmm… I wonder how good they are.

Anyway, here&apos;s their site. Baiscally it&apos;s only an online shop, but anyway:
