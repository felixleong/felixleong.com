{% mark post -%}For the past few days, I haven&apos;t been feeling extremely well… it&apos;s like, I&apos;m feeling some sort of emptiness that is started to engulf me… I wouldn&apos;t say that it was depression, but it seems that it has potential to bring depression in. Sometime I do wonder though, this emptiness seems to be extremely neutral… it&apos;s like… you can&apos;t say that it was good and bad, it&apos;s depends on how you look at it that matters. But then again… I really can&apos;t see how can I take this positively…

Anyway… been overspending lately, I don&apos;t know, somehow it did seem that buying things seems to be an escapist activity to me (at least from what I perceive it, anyway). But then again, it&apos;s really hard to resist JPop CDs for RM5 :p. Just bought Namie Amuro&apos;s GENIUS 2000, Aikawa Nanase&apos;s Purana and Yuzu&apos;s Yuzuen. All for RM5. :p

Also I got myself a hairdryer… and there&apos;re tons of CDs that I&apos;m bidding over eBay.

What else… … I need a hug ;____;.{%- endmark %}
