I guess this is not the first time I feel all down and lonely again for no real reason. I don&apos;t know, sometimes I just feel that… well, it&apos;s like I&apos;ve going back to square one. Hmm… or should I put it like, I feel exactly the same way like what I did during my depression period a year ago… or am I? I don&apos;t know, it just seems not me to delve into such negativity for such a long period of time, and it&apos;s like I came to a point where I just can&apos;t seem to motivate myself to do anything productive, not to mention I&apos;m starting to get pretty avoidant to quite a lot of serious things that has some sort of connection with "self-responsibility".

Honestly speaking I have no idea what is the real reason which makes me feeling down for. Probably you might say that "If you don&apos;t know the reason of what is making you feel down for, what&apos;s the use of feeling down in the first place." That&apos;s probably right from many aspects, and I totally agree with that. But it&apos;s like, from time to time, this negative feelings just seem to trigger and engulfs me whole. Perhaps using another analogy, probably it can be describe as I&apos;m just feeling sick, just the only difference is that the agony is much less physical.

Looking back to my past entries, I can&apos;t help but to notice that I did mention about this from time to time, probably to a point of repeating myself where the only difference is that how I describe this sort of unknown sorrow. Up until now, it&apos;s like I&apos;m still unable to identify what&apos;s causing this kind of emotion… is it low self-esteem? Anxiety? Loneliness? Being overly self-critical? Unsatisfied with my current situation/progress? Frankly speaking I would say that every one of them does contribute, but I just can&apos;t seem to indentify a main reason for this.

But I do notice that I&apos;m much more easily depressed when I didn&apos;t have enough sleep (I need 8 hours, anything less than 6 would make me feel weak) and when I&apos;m all stressed out, which is probably the case in which the main reason why I typed this post because this negativity is amplified by the day. But yet that doesn&apos;t explains what makes me feel extremely negative for.

Ah… I think I&apos;ll just stop here now.
