Well… just thought of sharing this because I really like this one :). It was originally posted in Chinese by time_traveller, and I liked it :). So I just did a translation and just would love to share with you :). The translation may be a little bit off at some point, but I tried my best.

Hope you like it! :D


<u><b>最真的开始！</b></u> by time_traveller
人一生中能爱几个人？
人一生中能被爱几次？
你还记得你初恋情人的样子吗？
你还记得你曾经为他做过多少傻事吗？
你还记得你们第一次的情人节是怎样过的吗？
你还记得当你第一次牵她手是在怎样的情况下吗？

当你想起这些的时候，你有在笑吗？
是笑自己的傻？是笑自己的过去？我们在笑些什么呢？
这个笑很甜，很苦，让人想哭！对吗？

每当想起这个人，心中总有阵阵的痛？
每当想起这个人，心中总有丝丝的甜！

还记得第一次发现自己心中初恋的痛的感觉吗？
“我想我恋爱了，感觉好痛，但是我好想一直痛下去．．．．”

你的初恋离开你了吗？
他为什么离开你了？
你还想他吗？
你还见得到他吗？
你们还有联络吗？

你现在身边的那位是否拥有你全部的爱？
还是你偷偷的留了一个位置给离开了你的她？

他真地离开了我吗？彻彻底底的从我生命中离开了吗？如果是，为什么每当想起他时，我的心总有阵阵想哭的感觉 呢？

爱的甜，爱的苦，爱的一切最真的感觉，爱的开始，使他给我的。
原来我不曾让他离开自己的生命。
虽然现在我的他早已在别人的身边，
虽然我已经好久没有见过他了。
但是我从没忘记他的样子，他的笑，他的生日，他的一切一切。

他是我最真的开始。

<u><b>Translation: The Realest Beginning</b></u>

[*Note: Since I&apos;m not sure what gender the author is targetting, so I tried to put it in a him/her way :)]

How many people one can love in his/her life?
How many times one can be loved in his/her life?
Do you still remember how your first love looks like?
Do you still remember how many silly things you have done for him/her?
Do you still remember how you celebrate your first Valentine&apos;s?
Do you still remember in what situation you hold his/her hand for the first time?

When you think about this, are you smiling?
Are you smiling of your silliness? Or are you smiling of your past? What we are smiling for?
This smile is so sweet, yet so bitter, that it makes us want to cry? Isn&apos;t it?

Everytime when you think of this person, your heart always feel the slight pains?
Everytime when you think of this person, your hearts always feel the slight sweetness!

Still remember the first time you notice the feeling of first-love-ache in your heart?

"I think I&apos;m in love, it feels so aching, yet I still want to feel that aching…"

Have your first love left you?
Why did he/she left you?
Do you still miss him/her?
Do you still able to see him/her again?
Are you still in contact?

Does the person next to you now have all the love you have?
Or you still silently keep a place in your heart for the person who have already leave you?

Did he/she really left me? Really left from my life completely? If so, why always when I think of him/her, my heart always have that sorrow tingling in me?

The sweetness of love, the bitter of love, the real feeling of everything in love, the beginning of love, is what he/she gave to me.
I realize that I never let him/her leave my own life
Although now my love is already with somebody else
Although I haven&apos;t seen him/her for a long time
I still never forget his/her face, his/her smile, his/her birthday, his/her everything.

He/she is my realest beginning.
