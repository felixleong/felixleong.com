{% mark post -%}Just arrived home :). Gave a few shocks to my family members, but it&apos;s really great to be back at home. It&apos;s really fun actually, being able to talk with my family on a lot of things.

Of course… they do care about me in terms of relationship stuff. And… honestly speaking, it&apos;s still a bit heartaching… but their intentions are good, so it&apos;s pretty much OK.

Anyway, be meeting up my friends tommorrow at my highschool. Preparing for more shocks ;P.{%- endmark %}
