What a great feeling :). It&apos;s like I&apos;m so glad that my health is improving by the day, and apparently my mood gets cheery day by day with my health conditions. I wonder why ^^. It just seems that during the times when I&apos;m feeling sickly, I was so bogged down by the viruses that I have no room to think about all those depressing stuff? Or probably I&apos;m just only stressed out that causes the sickness? Hmmâ€¦

And apparent, all of a sudden everything seems to go my way. It&apos;s like, everything I do just seem to go so smoothly that I never expect it. Maybe it&apos;s just my lucky day? :)

Yeah, the combinatronic midterm is over, so yay for that :D. And I think I fare better than my quizzes (speaking of which, I got my first 0 during my first quiz, which is REALLY depressing XD). Hopefully I can catch up with my school stuff soon. But then again, probably my bad habit of proscatination will get in the way :p. Ah well~

Somewhat I&apos;m in love with Lolita&apos;s Highway. It&apos;s featured in both my SEB80 and 90 and it really sounded really different and unique compared to other Elena (for those who&apos;s not into Eurobeat, Lolita is one of the many aliases she sings as) tracks. It&apos;s like, well, to me, it&apos;s like almost all Lolita and Virginelle songs sounds almost similar, and Highway seems to strike a complete contrast to her usual style (Almost like Magical Lover sang by Norma Sheffield in SEB75, which sounds more like Virginelle track than a Norma). I wonder whether Vicky have listened to that before. ^^

Guess that pretty much wraps up my normal day.
