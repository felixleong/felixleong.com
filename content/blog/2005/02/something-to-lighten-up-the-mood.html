SEB80 & 90 is in the mail <3333. Gotta love EMS shipping <3333~~

I&apos;m still listening them through, but first impression wise, they are a blast! :D I&apos;m sure they are going to make my day ^^. Now waiting for 3 items to end over eBay, and Norma Sheffield&apos;s Sweet Heaven in the mail.

Oh yeah! My digital camera finally got fixed ^^. That&apos;s pretty fast because it was repaired in one day :D. Bwee~~~ Now I want a good, tall tripod so that I can film Parapara everywhere ^^b.

You&apos;re beyond seductive, you&apos;re downright magnetic!
You life live and approach seduction on a grand scale.
You have an inner self confidence and energy that most people lack
It&apos;s these talents that make you seem extraordinary - and you truly are!</font></td></tr></table>

Umm… I don&apos;t know… self confidence… to be honest, I personally feel that my self confidence is more like a roller coaster, I just don&apos;t know when it peaks while other times gone down to the depths of the sea.
