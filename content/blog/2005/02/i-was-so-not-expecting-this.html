For one thing, it&apos;s stated in Club Japan that it will be sent through air mail, but apparently it came through EMS instead. O_O Uhhh… Ah well… they haven&apos;t charged my debit card yet so I&apos;m not completely sure how much that would have cost me. But probably around… say, 7200 yen? *crosses fingers that they&apos;ll charge me when the currency exchange isn&apos;t so high*.

But yay for me completing my PPP soundtrack collection ^^b.

#2: Cut&apos;d so that it won&apos;t spoil the mood of others.

OK… I&apos;M DARN FREAKING OUT!!!! One midterm <b>early in the morning</b> tommorrow. GAH! Judging my sleeping habits I must find SOME WAY to get myself to wake up before 8. And the worst thing? I haven&apos;t got the full set of notes to study *kills myself!* And the site where I can download these notes are currently too busy since there&apos;re much more students who do last minute work just as I do.

What else… Final year project thesis draft is due next week and I HAVEN&apos;T even completed a WORKABLE system. I&apos;m better than dead for my VR assignment (read: NO PROGRESS AT ALL!)

Great… This is NOT the first time I ever feel like being dead because of stress.

>.<" ARGH!!!! *yell my lungs out*
