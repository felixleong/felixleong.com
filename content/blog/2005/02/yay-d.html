{% mark post -%}私は日本語一級の勉強が終わった！おめでとう～

Well… I did have a little bit of help from my teacher to form the sentence just now :p. Yes, indeed, I finished my Japanese level 1 basic class today ^^v. So that&apos;s an achievement to me ^^. I already signed up for level 2 basic classes, hopefully they have enough students to conduct it ^^.

What else… oh yeah, I&apos;m starting to love Domino a lot (Nine! Get out of my head XDDD!)~~ <333 It&apos;s really like, just listening to her songs makes me feel upbeat. So now I&apos;m pretty much flipping through all her songs that I had in my SEB collection. w00tage!

Guess that pretty much cushions the depression blow that I&apos;m having lately :).Well… and now since I already found my secret "base" at school, where I can isolate myself for a while and to practice my paras at… guess I can keep my sanity for quite some time :p.

Aaah~~~ Domino&apos;s Feel My Heart <3333.{%- endmark %}
