[:: List of Unexpected Stuff ::]

    For one thing, it's stated in Club Japan that it will be sent through air mail, but apparently it came through EMS instead. O\_O Uhhh… Ah well… they haven't charged my debit card yet so I'm not completely sure how much that would have cost me. But probably around… say, 7200 yen? *crosses fingers that they'll charge me when the currency exchange isn't so high*.

    But yay for me completing my PPP soundtrack collection ^^b.

2: Cut'd so that it won't spoil the mood of others.

    OK… I'M DARN FREAKING OUT!!!! One midterm **early in the morning** tommorrow. GAH! Judging my sleeping habits I must find SOME WAY to get myself to wake up before 8. And the worst thing? I haven't got the full set of notes to study *kills myself!* And the site where I can download these notes are currently too busy since there're much more students who do last minute work just as I do.

    What else… Final year project thesis draft is due next week and I HAVEN'T even completed a WORKABLE system. I'm better than dead for my VR assignment (read: NO PROGRESS AT ALL!)

    Great… This is NOT the first time I ever feel like being dead because of stress.

    >.<" ARGH!!!! *yell my lungs out*
