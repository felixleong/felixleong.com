[FelixLeong.com](http://www.felixleong.com/) is currently up with my old site, Felix Leong presents PEDAGOGIES (which I suppose some [RPGamer](http://www.rpgamer.com/) boardies know that it's my manga drawing tutorial site when I was active in Fanart section). I didn't do any changes since the last update three years ago, but that's about to change ;).

And another thing is that I just learnt the paras for Stay The Night / Dave Rodgers and I Love You Babe / King & Queen, which means that I have completed with learning all the paras in Parapara Paradise 1! :D Planning to conquer the remaining few that I haven't learn in PPP2. And one thing is that I really liked Stay The Night, as in both the song and the para! Luckily the well known Maki's Biggest PPP Blunder didn't happen to me (otherwise most likely I'll hit furniture XDDDD). I just feel so energetic doing that para :D.

Anyway, back to work! :D
