First time ever that I have to come for overtime, not to mention that we are not paid extra for it :P.

But nevertheless it is not that bad, in fact it was pretty fun as I have company here :). Anyway, just came here to finish a specification for the purpose of hiring a technical editor: Or put it plainly, the boss is hiring somebody to correct our English.

Hmmm… and now I'm hungry and yet I'm still in the office… *tummy growls*
