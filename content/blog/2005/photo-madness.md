Copied all my photographs from my office PC back home, and managing almost close to 2000 photographs is COMPLETE madness!

Probably the easier part is to convert all motion JPEG videos into a more space friendly form such as DivX or WMV. The harder part is to filter the pictures that is beyond what I'm able to fix and those which is not good for keeping (= put it bluntly, bad/awful/junk).

That would probably take me days to sort them out, if not weeks.

But at least I have them over in my computer now :).
