Yesterday wasn't really a good day for me as I found myself having a heavy heart for no apparent reason (wellâ€¦ there might be a reason, but it's really something that I can't really comprehend well, in a sense) Sometimes I do wonder whether people can influence each other feelings, even just by being close to them. But probably there's just too much not-so-happy incidents happening to my friends that I'm really concern about them.

Anyway, Theen Gee, who has been my roommate for 2 months, will be moving as his industrial training is over (and his semester is going to start on next month). There'll be a farewell dinner for him tonight.That pretty much means that I'll having the room for myself, which I really have some mixed feelings for it, bt I'll be OK :). Probably I would miss sharing my drifting thoughts with him (that's the reason if you did notice that I didn't post much over here in LJ).

Anyway, it's a fresh day today :). Better get myself back into position.
