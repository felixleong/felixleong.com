After being out there for 8 hours or so, I have returned from my shopping trip :). Anyway, just out of extreme boredom, I went out to Sunway Piramid, originally just going there to window shop for clothes, but it seems that my head kept on chanting: buy, buy, BUY~~! So I ended up getting one set of my Chinese New Year clothing :p. But that's pretty much planned anyway :).

Anyway, after some considerations, I decided that I'll pick my own clothes for my Ice style, while I'll let (probably) Erika and the gang to pick the clothes for my Fire style. Fair enough, huh ;)? Anyway, for my Ice style, here's my pick of clothes:
- Forest light green casual tee, with "Regain Freedom: Break The Chain, Release Your Soul" written on it (about RM17)
- Cheetah plain white long sleeve tee (about RM23)
- BUM dark khaki coloured khakis, and OOOOH~ I love pants from BUM <333 So comfortable and stylish~ (about RM72)
- To add a finishing touch, I bought myself a necklace, which I have been dreading to have one every since last year (RM20)

Here's a picture of the whole set ^^:

Just to comment:

Augh! The hardest clothing to find is actually a nice, cool, green shirt >.<". Not to mention even harder to get the colours that I wanted. Basically it did took me like an hour to get this one. But after I tried it on for the first time, I only realise why most <i>green</i> clothes aren't that popular: it's REALLY hard to look nice in them >.<". But luckily I did find a lot of matching stuff to make it look nice on me ^^ (well… at least I THINK that it looked nice on me XD).

The long sleeves shirt isn't that hard for me to get since I know I wanted them, just that I can't decide whether I want it for Fire or Ice. But the khaki's pretty much struck me instantly and I just fell in love with them just the first time I set my eyes on them ^^.

The necklace came as an after thought though, since I was thinking of getting an accessory to go with the whole set of the clothes (umm… since I personally feel that the green is a little bit too loud). Originally I was thinking of getting one strap that dangles on the khakis, but when I pass through a shop which sell a lot of these necklace and stuff, I just happen to go in there and bought one necklace instead. Hmmm…

Anyway, as usual, I took a lot of photos today :3, enjoy! (Gotta love Chinese New Year's decorations ^^)

Don't ask why I didn't smile in this set, because I don't know why XDDD.
