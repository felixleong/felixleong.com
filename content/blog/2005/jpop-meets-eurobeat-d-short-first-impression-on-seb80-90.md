Wooo~ I'm loving my SEB80 and 90 <333. Now THAT'S what I call a awesome non-stop remix CD :D. Really, listening through SEB80 and 90 is definitely a blast and now SEB110 and 120 seems more to me like a "been there, done that" attempt :p.

I really liked how they did put in a lot of sound remix effects and some Eurobeat parody into the mix. A very memorable one is definitely how DJ Shu did the effects for Hot Love and Emotion / Virginelle, it's like, the entering transitions uses some of the most memorable Virginelle songs and it goes like "Kiss Me Kiss Me Babe, Why Not, Mystery of Love, Don't You Love Me, Every girl is giving too~~ (sabi ending for Hot Love and Emotion)", and later on in the A-melo, DJ Shu creatively put in snipplets of Don't You Love Me and Lucky Lucky into the ending of every verse. :D Now that's what I call creative :D.

It's really hard to describe how cool these CDs were and I would say that it is a must have for all Eurobeat collectors :).

And the cooler part is that SEB80 & 90 each came with a small CD which contains… Covers of JPop tunes! :D I mean, how often do we get to listen Eurobeat singers singing to JPop? And they are really impressively done *ish touched*.

Let's see, the list goes:

**SEB80:**

1. Boy Meet Girl / Domino (trf),
2. Body feels EXIT / Virginelle (Namie Amuro),
3. Feel Like dance / Cherry (globe),
4. EZ DO DANCE / Helena (trf)

**SEB90:**

1. Feel My Heart / Domino (Every Little Thing),
2. Dear My Friend / Cherry (Every Little Thing),
3. Future world / Helena (Every Little Thing),
4. Go To The Top / Dave Rodger (New tune)

And unlike J-Euro covers, these songs are really a blast. :D You just have to listen to them to know how good they were :D. Out of all of them, I like Body feels EXIT / Virginelle and Feel My Heart / Domino the best :).

Speaking of Feel My Heart… this song really touches me, thanks to Domino's powerful vocal and the meaningful lyrics as well. Somehow I think I'll venture into Every Little Thing someday :).

I think I'll stop here now. ;)

[p/s: I'm currently bidding on Domino's CD. Damn I think I'm starting to get addicted to Domino already XDDDD.]
