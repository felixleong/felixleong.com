Rewinding back to Thursday as we went to Port Dickson (it's one of Malaysia's popular tourist destination, once popular for its beautiful beaches). This time we have even more people joining the fun, 10 to be exact: Sze Hau, Sook Lan and her husband, Hui Ying, Francis, Seng Yaw and his girlfriend, Yuen Hui and her brother and myself.

It's around noon when Hui Ying, Francis and myself gathering at A&W near my place, waiting for Sze Hau to drive us there. It's pretty surprising to see Sze Hau looking a little bit different after his one week vacation to Korea: he seems to look more handsome and cheerful than before. Somehow I really wonder whether is it just me or it's myâ€¦ umm, distorted mental image playing games with me :p. After we had our lunch there, we soon departed to Port Dickson.

After a few hours drive there and *barely* missing a signboard showing the direction to our resort (no thanks to the signboard that doesn't stand out from the crowding signboards), we checked into Ilham beach resort. The beach resort is beautiful, which has an architectural design which reflects the Malay designs in Negeri Sembilan (the state in which Port Dickson is in), with lots of impressive wooden furnishings. Soon after, Seng Yaw and the others arrived. We quickly shoved our stuff in our rooms and rushed to the beach.

Excited as I were, the beach seems to dampen my excitement a bit. Probably it's because of the tide, a lot of black debris seems to be washed up on the beach, making the beach a very sorry sight to watch. Not to mention the sea water is pretty polluted, which we would need to go pretty far away in order to see the blue of the waters. Does made me wonder whether the beach's over exposure to human habitation and visits causes this, or is it that our irresponsible behaviour has caused the once beautiful beach to deteriorate?

To our disappointment, we ended up going to the swimming pool to instead, probably having the swimming pool act as the no-where-from-being-impressive alternative. And honestly speaking, there's no way for the swimming pool to be as exciting as the sea.

But we soon forgot our disappointment when we walk up to the lighthouse on a hill. We basically walked our way up the hill, which is basically a forest reserve. As we walked our way up, we get to hear a lot of stories about Sook Lan's trip to Korea. As soon we reached up there, we took a lot of pictures. However, we are shocked by a few occurrence of loud firecrackers being thrown at our direction. We have no idea who threw it, probably the guard manning the lighthouse?

We soon head our way done and have our BBQ at night. It's a lot of fun really, as we help each other preparing the food, eating as well as talk and joke around with each other. Then we just sat near the beach, enjoying the sea breeze. It's a really relaxing experience, having the breeze surrounding us. Then we go back to our resort room and continue our fun with card games and Mahjongg.

The next day, we checked out from our rooms and departed to Melaka (the neighbouring state). We only went to Jonker Street for food, and gosh the traffic is really bad o\_O". Guess everyone came here during the festive season? We went to one of the popular Hainanese chicken rice ball (it's essentially chicken cooked with soy sauce and sesame oil, served with specially prepared rice balls) restaurant, and was soon shocked at the queue there. It took around an hour or two until we actually got seated in. Honestly speaking there's nothing extremely special about the food, but I do enjoyed it.

Then we go around Jonker Street shopping some tidbits and took a lot of pictures around this place.

We headed straight home at around 6 in the evening: feeling tired, but happy. :)

Will upload the photographs as soon as I get my hands on them ;).
