Nothing much apart from doing assignments back home, and I feel much more relieved after the drifting thought entry. :)

Somewhat it seems that I sensed that some change is going to happen to me pretty soon. I wonder what will that beâ€¦

And as a random note, I think I'm starting to be able to identify Domino's voice. Hmmmmmmmmm~~~~
