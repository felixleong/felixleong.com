Just got a new graphic card replaced for my PC, so currently my PC is running fine and dandyâ€¦ or maybe not. As I'm trying to install the card into my PC, Windows XP just didn't feel like cooperating and would never let me install the driver for the graphic card. So I'm like "OK, so probably I'll do a fresh install" and although that works, I can't get 1024x768 to work! GAH!!! So now I'm facing a large-ish 800x600 screen (as in the UI stuff instead of UI space).

So now not only I have to find the time to reinstall all the software back into my PC, I also have to deal with the resolution issue. I have downloaded the latest graphic card driver, I really hope that it'll solve the problem because 800x600 really makes me sad :(.

No Internet for the time being as I don't think I'll be replacing another 56K modem soon due to my current financial situation. But it's a good thing as I would really love to take a break from the Internet for a while.

One assignment is due tommorrow together with my combinatronics test O\_O". I really hoped that things will go well.
