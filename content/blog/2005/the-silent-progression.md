It's been a few days that I have been finding myself in a much mediocre mood (Hmm… Can I really use the adjective "mediocre" to decribe my mood and feelings?). Not really hate it but I don't really like it either. Just feeling stuck in the middle while I feel like I'm gently being pushed by both sides.

But probably it's just being a little bit less eventful, I guess. Probably it's a good time to take an emotional break after all the intense feelings that I have experienced last year :). (I'm wondering whether this statement indirectly conveys the fact that I didn't really let my past go until now…? Hmm…)

Just came to me like I have more things to learn and to seek in many aspects.

Anyway, on a much lighter note, I REALLY want SEB160 badly! It's been a while I have last felt a rush of excitement when I look at album tracklists! :D The tracklist of SEB160 is definitely refreshing as it has a really good blend and mixture from different labels and Eurobeat styles (instead of seeing the same "Dominating ABeatC, supporting Delta and a few classics from Time stranded here and there loosely in between" formula that has been the very theme of SEB albums in the past). I'm definitely getting it as soon as I can allocate some spare money! :D

And with all my eBay Favourite Searches being set up and my constant monitoring of CD shops (online and off), it does seems that I'm getting to some CD shopping frenzy :p. I really hope that it'd not bang my budget, considering my currently wishlist for books and other stuff are getting longer and longer.
