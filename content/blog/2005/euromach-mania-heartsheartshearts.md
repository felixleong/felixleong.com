My Euromach CDs just came into the mail today :D! OK, maybe not from the mail directly but I just went to the post office to collect it this morning. And The Best of Euromach 2001 has awesome non-stop remixing goodness <3<3<3! And of course finally I got a copy of Euromach 1 (which I really wanted it so badly)!

And to my surprise I manage to keep my hands on the keyboard while listening to these CDs during work :p (instead of making Parapara gestures XDDDD).

Rewinds things back to yesterday and the day before, nothing much happened except the fact that I'm getting really fatigued physically for the past two days x\_x. But I'm in good condition now after a really good sleep :).

Other than that… things are getting busy over here lately :), going back to Kuala Kangsar (my hometown) tommorrow! (Yay! Paradise!)
