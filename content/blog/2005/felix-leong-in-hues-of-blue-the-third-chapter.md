I guess this is almost the time to enter my next phase in life, so I changed my info a bit.

As usual, I changed the poem in my user info, so just to keep a copy of it:

## Chapter 2: Nov'04

> "In awe, I receive messages from the past --  
>  lyrics that become self-prophesies,  
>  coincidences that remind me of my destiny,  
>  voices of singers long gone.
> 
>  They tell me that whichever path I choose  
>  will take me home."
> 
> -- *Utada Hikaru, from her Single Collection Vol.1 1998-2003 album cover*

No longer I am who I was…  
For life have shown me possibilities…

The miracle is now  
Where every word dances along with my existence

The adventure is now  
Where every single present is calling my notice

My times has been marked  
When I noticed that life wonders doesn't only come in joy and happiness

My answers have been found  
For existences doesn't have a reason

For now…  
My destiny is clear:  
To seek, to appreciate, and to understand…

No matter whichever path I took…  
It'll take me home…

Just believe… the strength within…  
For faith is useless if fate is unchangable…

This is the new poem. Not as good as my first or second, but I think I'm able to think of a better one when this journal reach its fourth chapter :).

## Chapter 3: May'05

Time passes  
As I am watching  
The ebb and flow of life

At times of constant change  
I still know deep down  
That what's deep and true will always stay

Horizons broaden when I seek  
Wisdom accumulated when I understand  
Happiness blooms when I appreciate

As my story continues to unfold  
I will continue my dance and song  
As I continue wander around my life journey
