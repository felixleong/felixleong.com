PHEW! That&apos;s a mouthful :p. (I mean the title)

Anyway, things have been pretty slow today, which is not really a good thing considering the fact that I only had that much time to revise for my exam.

I designed a poster for Dr Tay yesterday for the Computer Vision and Intelligent Systems (CVIS) Group. Basically this poster is going to be displayed during our university&apos;s open day and my final year project will be presented there as well. :)

And yes I&apos;m still experimenting with some simple vector arts in these :). And recently I have been spending time experimenting with new colours schemes, so this time round I fool around with contrasting colours (magic pink and earth green tones) and pastel like colours.  I really like how the colours turns out for one thing. And yeah I did cheat on the eyes part as I used the tracing feature of Inkscape :p.

What elseâ€¦ yeah, I&apos;m getting closer to nailing down the job, hopefully I&apos;ll get it :).
