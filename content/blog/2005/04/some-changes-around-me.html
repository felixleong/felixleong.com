And so I just reached home.

Qing Ming is pretty smooth and sunny yesterday :), but sunny might be the negative part of things as it&apos;s blazing hot out there without any shades from anything on top of my head :p. Then I have to go back home as I do have classes today :(. But at least on the way with aunt Ling and uncle Vincent has been pretty fun :), for one thing I get to know Terrance better and got to continue (and finish) watching Initial D Third Stage The Movie. <3 And I&apos;m really excited to get to know more friends better along the way (which includes my team mates for my virtual reality assignment).

The second news is that now I&apos;ll be having two roommates as two of my friends, Steven and Ting Gee, moved into my room :) (Some of you might recall that Steven is my best friend from college). Just a mention, Ting Gee used to be my course mate from college for one semester, and I didn&apos;t keep in touch with him after he got a offer from a public university at that time. As much that means that I have less private space now, but at least I won&apos;t be that lonely at night.

What elseâ€¦ Oh yeah, just got a Japanese personal word processor from my mom&apos;s friend, Ms Chee :). It&apos;s basically an electronic typewriter combined with a dot matrix printer, and it sports a Japanese keyboard. I haven&apos;t got my hands on it as I still need a electrical output convertor for it. But it&apos;s going to be really fun with it. And Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks definitely rocks <333.

And I finally managed to save my personal data which I have lost :). Yay, so that&apos;s good news for me.

Just an announcement, I decided to pull myself off from the Internet for a full two weeks apart from updating my LJ. There&apos;s a few reasons to it: I have not much money to buy a brand new modem, as well as giving myself some time to readjust myself and understand my own emotions (positive or not).

Guess that&apos;s pretty much it. While I&apos;m typing this entry, I&apos;m still rendering my virtual reality assignment, which my team will be presenting tomorrow. Will post the final video up later :).
