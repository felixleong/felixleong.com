{% mark post -%}Ugh… preparing for my last paper (Parallel processing) tomorrow isn&apos;t really fun at all as I find my head spinning when I go through all the lecture slides. Been seeing imaginary planetary orbits from the beginning until now. I really don&apos;t know how&apos;s the outcome for tomorrow&apos;s paper, I&apos;m really worried that I can&apos;t get good grades for this one (since I got a lot of marks for my assignments).

Just to recap, yesterday is pretty fun as Steven, Jacob, Theen Gee and his girlfriend and I went out together. As usual with any outing with Steven, there&apos;s always karaoke :). And boy that was fun as I attempted to sing Ayu&apos;s songs there :). It&apos;s would be great if they had ANGEL&apos;S SONG and GAME, but well, at least they do have M :). It just came to me that M really sang my heart out.

Then we went to Border&apos;s, which just opened a few days ago. And boy I just love the book selections and the atmosphere :). It&apos;s definitely going to be one of my favourite hangout place in the future :). Currently there&apos;s quite a lot of books and stuff that I wanted there, but looking at my current financial situation… well, probably I might get them some time later :).

And one thing that really can&apos;t forgive Steven is that he (together with Theen Gee and his girlfriend) have left me and Jacob at Border&apos;s while they went somewhere else! Grr… but it&apos;s not really a bad thing either, been spending some time catching up news and stuff, and it is really fun going out with Jacob :). Just have to remind me of my college days.

OK, I better stop here now and get my head spinning all over again!{%- endmark %}
