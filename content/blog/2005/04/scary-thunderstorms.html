{% mark post -%}For those who are figuring of why the lack of updates, basically I&apos;m OK. Just that the recent thunderstorms and the heavy downpour is extremely scary, and my main phone line got snapped and no phone + Internet for the past few days.

But everything is OK now, but probably I should go out and shop for a 56K modem since I can&apos;t be borrowing Theen Gee&apos;s notebook everytime I wanted to surf around.

Exam officially started yesterday, with virtual reality to kickstart everything. I&apos;ll be taking three subjects, Virtual Reality is done with, Combinatronics tommorrow and Parallel Processing a week later. For the Virtual Reality paper, I believe I did pretty well, despite the fact that my hands ache after the whole 2 hours and I didn&apos;t manage to complete the whole paper. But things are pretty good and I believe that I answered them considerably well.

I&apos;m a little bit nervous about tommorrow though, since Combinatronics has to be my weakest link. But I&apos;m going to do more tutorials just to make sure that I have enough exposure to different types of problems.

Gotta go now!{%- endmark %}
