{% mark post -%}Let&apos;s see… more annoyance that I really feel really f&apos;d (Guess that&apos;s pretty implied) up. The list continues:
- I notice that graphic card I bought is really a cheap imitation D:. OK, probably the chipset is definitely right (as shown in the BIOS screen anyway), but there&apos;s definitely something really wrong with the electronics or the the driver provided (since I notice that the driver is written for… nVidia chipsets?!)

So I really don&apos;t know what should I do with it now actually. Although it is OK to do my daily task, the games are EXTREMELY sluggish. And since the card is still usable, I don&apos;t think I can get a refund or an exchange of hardware. Hope I DON&apos;T have to buy another new graphics card later.

- I really messed up my files: BIG time. Currently I accidentally deleted my own folder, which means that my photographs, videos and @Music files have been deleted O_O". I&apos;m not worried about the videos since I guess I can get them back from PPStage (although I have to download a hell lot to get them back), the photographs and my data is extremely precious to me that I really have no way to recover them back T-T. Not to mention that four music files that I have bought from @Music cost me 840 yen (around RM40) *stare at blank folder*…

- Done badly for my combinatronics test…

I don&apos;t know… I really hope that I really know a way to reverse this unfortunate events.

But for now, I better focus on my assignment.{%- endmark %}
