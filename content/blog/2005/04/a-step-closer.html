Phew! What a tiring day. Honestly speaking this first experience in job application does somewhat overwhelming me to the point that I have been commented by various people I met along the way that I looked tensed, nervous and/or absent-minded XDDD. But luckily everything went on pretty smoothly.

So basically I just went to the company&apos;s HR department and obtain all the documents that I needed to fill up for my first ever job application, then later on I proceed in opening a bank account and doing my medical checkup as required for the job. And honestly speaking, as much I don&apos;t actually feel nervous, but a lot of times I just found myself a lost of words as I clumsily proceed with all these procedures that I&apos;m totally unfamiliar with. But I consider myself extremely lucky as the staff members whom I&apos;m engaged with were extremely friendly and patient enough to get everything done without much problems.

Somehow it suddenly occurred to me that when I was walking my way back, I suddenly found that the surroundings that I thought I was really familiar with has suddenly became unfamiliar. Umm… OK, probably that&apos;s a little bit complex. Just some side info, in the past, I&apos;m quite familiar with the routes around my company&apos;s building as I usually pass through them when I wanted to go to some major shopping areas close to it. And all this while I kinda perceived that I already know this place. Then suddenly when I knew that I&apos;ll be working around here, it just came to me that I only knew that much: after the thoughts of where can I get the cheapest food around, where is the stores are located, etc. came to my mind. And I have no clue to those questions.

Thinking about it, it&apos;s really like I&apos;m getting into a whole new territory after I accepted this job letter. Thinking about all the changes involved does seem to be kinda scary, you know: new people, new places, new environment, new social expectations, new lifestyle… new everything. But I suppose I have to learn how to adapt to it. After all, I guess it would be the same thing if I were to continue my studies overseas (which is definitely in my plans). :)

So that&apos;s about it for today.

Speaking of which, on the lighter note, I just found a shop which sell men&apos;s accessories, and I found quite a lot of cool stuff which I would want to have :). Probably thinking of buying a few set of cool clothes for a different look :).
