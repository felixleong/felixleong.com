Phew! Finally done with my virtual reality assignment, and I&apos;m really glad that the final output looks awesome :). Great thanks to my group members in making this a blast! :D (especially Chong Seng who did the trees and flowers :D)

Anyway, enough talk~ Here&apos;s the cool stuff :):

(* Note: These are rendered slightly before I do some final modification to the garden, so it does looks a little bit different from the final garden in the video. I&apos;ll post them up next time)
