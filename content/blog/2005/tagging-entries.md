Been spending some time tagging my previous LJ entries, so that I can categorise some of my most important and valuable threads. I managed to tag everything from last December until now, which means I'm left with like… 11 months worth of entries @\_@||. But it's not a very hard process, so I think I can do that later.

The main reason I do this is to archive all my drifting thoughts, so that I can review it in times to come. For those who are interested, [you can refer to them here]({category}Reflections):

It contains a lot of my own thoughts, philosophies, inquiries, personal development and some of my personal history. Somehow just skimming through them makes me feel like there's a lot of recurring themes in these.

It's definitely a long read, for one thing :p.

Note: Just as a disclaimer, some of these drifting thoughts touches on the issue of sexuality (considering the fact that my fundamental belief that love knows no barriers). So if you aren't really comfortable with these kind of topic, well… you decide what to do yourself ^^".

Note #2: There's about 50 entries in there at the moment, probably will amount to something like 80~100 when I finished tagging all of them… which probably I'll finish it by next week
