OK! Yesterday's recap (this is what happens when I get too tired to update my LJ after a tiring day, especially when an aerobics class is being thrown in):

A LOT of drama happen in the office yesterday, which cause most of our colleagues going up and down and running around to solve the matter. For those who is getting worried with the word "drama", don't worry, because it **doesn't involve any people but office equipment** :p.

Just to elaborate, basically what happened yesterday is that we have to go to the 19th floor (we are currently at the 23rd floor) to loan some PCs for our new colleagues. So during the process we spent almost half a day setting up their PC, settling up some office space issues (no thanks to the "cable length dillema", i.e. the cables always being not long enough to go to the nearest router, plugpoint etc.), ironing out some of the creases after booting up their PCs (i.e. software hiccups). It was a lot of work, not to mention that my body gets all fatigued after this.

Then later on, our office's water dispenser have a broken tap. Worse, it's the hot water tap which got broken! O\_O" And so we have some hot thrills and spills around the office before we decided to cut our "lifeline" off (i.e. Cut off the water supply). It's still not fixed now so we have to go to the pantry like miles away from our office. Hope it will be fixed today.

As for today (umm, this morning) there's some technical problems with the light rail transit (LRT), which makes the whole commuting experience sluggish and umm… packed. But luckily I manage to get myself out from this madness by going to take a monorail halfway through. Somehow I'm just curious what happened there at the LRT… hmm…
