Just bought this song over [@music](http://atmusic.avexnet.or.jp/wma/) and it really lighten up my mood just now :).

Anyway, considering this is their debut single, their vocals might be a little bit unpolished, but overall it's all clean, upbeat and cute to listen to :). The syncs are a little bit rough, by the way, but it follows really closely to the original so no complains on that one.

OK, enough talk!
