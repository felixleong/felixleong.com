This morning my mood is totally poo for no apparent reason ;\_;. Depression, I suppose?

But after I slept in the bus on my way home, and once I woke up, it's like… the sorrow is not there anymore. Hmmm…

In other news, midterms and due dates… there are coming my way starting tommorrow *shivers*. And I won Domino's Tora Tora Tora album <333. That's pretty much it.
