Don't try to be hostile to those who intend to help, even if these help come or executed in a offending way to you. Your attempt to protect your ego will backfire to you in the end.

Hence, should there's something you can't agree upon, debate to search the truth, but never fight like a barbarian to protect your illusionary ego.
