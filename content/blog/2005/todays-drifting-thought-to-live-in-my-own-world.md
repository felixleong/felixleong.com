Ever happen to you that there's sometimes that you feel that you're detached from the actual community that you are in, but then again, it's not completely so? I don't know, that how I feel exactly after I came back for school after the 2-3 week haitus. It's like, when I mix with people, I just find myself in some sort of an awkward situation where even when I'm talking to close friends, I just feel like I'm talking with somebody that I only knew recently, or vice versa (as in I feel like they are chattting with me like I'm a different person).

It's kinda funny though, is it that I have changed? Or is it the environment and the people have changed, and I didn't keep myself updated with it? I don't really know about the former (probably I have changed in many minor aspects), but I did notice a lot of the latter.

Sometimes I just seem to recall that some people commented that I'm living my life as if I'm living in my own world. Honestly up until now I don't think I really understand what that meant. Probably it implies that my way of thinking and conduct is a little bit… umm, unique? Or does that it implies that I'm a bit over self-centred? Or is it that sometimes that I always spend time on working on my thoughts and ideals that my perception of reality isn't close to what reality really is? But then again, by what we define reality? Social norms and values? Or is it something else?

…

Anyway, I guess that's something that I would need to work out for myself. But I'm glad that I'm still among with people and they acknowledge my presence.

… Another month and my university life will end. Somehow I've mixed thoughts about this, as much as I don't understand what I'm feeling now. It's like… I'll be entering another phase in life, and it just seems that I'm sensing another major change in myself which I'm unable to predict.

… Guess time will tell.
