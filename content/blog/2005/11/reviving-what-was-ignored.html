Just bought a new external housing for my long forgotten notebook hard drive. Somehow I can't believe how much junk I have stuffed into my hard drive in the past :p. Kind of a relief that I can still retrieve back some of my old Eurobeat MP3s that I have downloaded in the past. It wasn't much, around 10 or so, but I'm just happy because there are some of the mostly missed music (Don't You Love Me, Go Go's And The Monkeys, Not For Sale etc.).

Somehow I wiped out the data in there… as much there are some past written work which I have poured in a lot of effort. I can still remember those memories vividly. But… well… in the end, I still persisted in wiping them off… somehow like a let-go of sorts. As much these bytes holds some unknown value to me, but honestly speaking I don't think I would want to hold any more digital dust.

Kind of a slight heartaching experience, but at least I got some free space to collect more digital dust?

In other news, as much I have been living my life very well… my heart still feels like aimless drifting -- In search of something: Self identity? Meaning of life? The truth? Enlightenment?

Somehow I just have to face the fact that some day or the other, I would have to face what is bound to happen in some way or the other. It's my responsibility to bear any consequences of my own actions. Just thinking whether I'm waiting patiently for the time to come? Or is it that I'm just postponing the inevitable?

Sometimes I just keep on confusing myself unnecessarily, I guess.

Anyway, for those who are concerned, nothing really happened from my own external spectrum of things. That pretty much all my recent updates reflects more of what's happening internally as a human soul. I think that's a good description of what's my entries were lately.
