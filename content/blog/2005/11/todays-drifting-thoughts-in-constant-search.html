{% mark post -%}Within a few days of sickness and pain, my own being seems to be in disorganization. Somehow it does made me realise the importance of keeping the mind, heart, body and soul in harmony with existence. In moments of dischord, only to realise how much unawareness of one's actions, repression and the illusory ego can cause self-inflicted wounds to one being.

â€¦

Coming back to real life, been picking up Japanese again, this time round I'm sure I'll make it. I have also been reading Chuang Tsu, and probably I would read more about the great thinkers in the past in a quest of searching.

Currently still in the process of recovery (mainly from the physical aspect, but it's not really a big issue now) and catching up with everything in the office.{%- endmark %}
