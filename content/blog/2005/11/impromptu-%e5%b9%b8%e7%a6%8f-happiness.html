幸福，就像空气一样，一直都是在你我身边。只能凭感觉和感受才能发现它的存在。

或许是因为我们看不到，摸不到，听不到，嗅不到，尝不到，我们都拼命地去追求，去寻找。很多时候就因如此忘了停下脚步，喘不过气来的当时，才发现让自己不能够呼吸的…就是自己的愚昧。

或许那时会发现自己刻意去寻找的气力可能是一种白费，但其实这个寻找的过程是个隐饰的幸福吧！就因为这种喘不过气的痛苦，才能让我们深深体会到空气的存在。

…这就是幸福。

Happiness is like air, always surrounds you and me. Only through our feeling and sense that we are able to notice its existence.

Maybe it's because that we can't see, touch, hear, sniff or taste it, we are always in a quest to pursuing and search vigorously. But a lot of times we forget to stop our footsteps because of our attempts, until the time that we desparately catch our breaths, only we realise that the reason that cause our difficulty of breathing… is our stupidity.

Maybe at that time we might think that the energy spent in our search is a big wastage, but actually this searching process is happiness in disguise! It's only because of the great pains of us being out of breath that let us realise the existence of air deep inside us.

… This is happiness.
