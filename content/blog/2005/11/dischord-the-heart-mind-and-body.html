During my week up there in Genting, I have pretty much suffered from sickness in the heart and body. And now while I'm still recovering, I can say that I have sickness in the mind as well, considering the fact that my head hurts that I can't really think.

As much it's not much of a bad thing since there's much less rubbish in my brain, but the biggest annoyance is that the aching! Ughâ€¦

Still recovering from my illness.
