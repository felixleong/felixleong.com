Why the unnecessary anguish? Is it a jealousy of your reality? Or is it that I'm jealous of the best illusory ending for you in my mind?

Sometimes it just so hard to bear, that it seem so impossible to get myself fitting into the best picture for you. Is it that I'm letting way so that you are able to find what's best for you? Or is it that I don't feel confident in myself that probably I am already the best for you…?

… Or is it that I fell in my own illusory world, that all my perceptions towards you is everything but the reality…?
