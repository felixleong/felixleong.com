{% mark post -%}Anything could happen, anything is possible. The only certainty is change.

That itself make every single cell in me trembleâ€¦ Who knows, the next minute I'll achieve my goals, or conversely I would lose everything that I hold dear.

Is it an attachment of security? Or is it that I fear of the possibility of the worst possible scenario?

Only to realise what I'm clinging onto is not reality but only an illusion of perception.
