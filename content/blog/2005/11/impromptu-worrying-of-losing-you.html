{% mark post -%}想着…或许，永远都不能够把自己真正的心声传达给心中最在乎的人。与其说是迟钝，那还带有胆怯的气息才更加糟糕吧！

所以…或许，永远只是傻乎乎地，眼睁睁地看着你的身影擦肩而过吧！之所以在你身边，总是觉得患得患失的惊惶失措吧！

呵呵…或许，自己永远都不愿意承认自己有一点不现实的浪漫情结吧！

Thinking… Maybe, I'll never say my real, heartfelt words to the people that I cared the most forever. Instead of saying that's being slow, having an extra taste of timidness makes it even worse.

Therefore… Maybe, I'll only be able to see you passing by me forever. That because every time I'm by your side, I always feel a little bit panicky with worries of losing you!

*chuckles*… Maybe, I'll never admit that I have that unrealistic attachment to romanticism forever!

*Currently still learning how to live more courageously.* ^^"{%- endmark %}
