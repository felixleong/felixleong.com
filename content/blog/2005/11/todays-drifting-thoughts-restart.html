Being more conscious and aware with my own being, I'm starting to realise and notice how imperfect I was. Through witnessing more and more of my actions, I'm starting to notice even I myself commit myself to mistakes that I have criticise others about -- tons of them, in fact.

Just as I thought I have perfected the art of my own doings, being instantly aware and witnessing my own actions made me realise all my own mistakes and imperfections.

A lot of fragments to pick up, so it seems. ^-^" Seems that my own unawareness, ignorance and ego does cloud my own perception all this while.

So back to square one and learning all the basics. :p
