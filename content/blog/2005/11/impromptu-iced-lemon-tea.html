{% mark post -%}对很多朋友来说，很多只晓得我喜欢喝柠檬茶，并不知道它背后隐藏的感觉。

不知为何，在学院念书的时期首次接触到它的时候就一“饮”钟情：因为它就象自己所向往的恋爱吧！它酸中带甜，微苦中带着清甘，虽然摸着杯子觉得冰冰地，但喝了下去后却让身子觉得暖暖地感觉。没红茶一般高贵，反而让人喜欢它有点独特，有点情调的平凡。

…或许就因如此，每次想念着你的当时一定会想起了柠檬茶…一个很天真的习惯吧。:)

To a lot of friends, they only knew that I loved iced lemon tea, but they don't know the emotions behind that.

I don't know why, during the time when I was studying in college, I fell in love with the drink when I first exposed to it: Because it's like the kind of love that I'm looking forward to! Behind sour and bitterness lie the essence of sweetness, although I feel the chillness when I hold the cup, but every sip of the drink makes me feeling warm inside. Even it's not as elegant as tea itself, but I love it for being unique and sentimental, despite being ordinary.

… Maybe that's why, every time I thought of you it'll definitely reminds me of a cup of iced lemon tea… maybe it's a childish habit of mine :).{%- endmark %}
