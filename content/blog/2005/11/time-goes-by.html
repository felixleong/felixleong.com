Passed through my 23rd birthday pretty much in a normal fashion, without any celebration or fanfare.

Been working as a facilitator of the programming competition organized by our company (or more exactly, my department) today.

But nonetheless I have a great time, just being around with friends, chatting, joking away and having a great time. Simple as these little things were, to me, its a great present. :)
