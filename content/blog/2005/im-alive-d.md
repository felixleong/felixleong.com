OK, just to say that I'm still alive, but my dialup Internet credits has been used up so that I won't be able to be online these few days. Still prodding my bank to get my Internet bill settled :'-(.

Anyway, quite a few major events happening. Just to make things short, I'm having the CODS during the past few days, which is pretty aching :'-(. Then on Saturday, I went to Genting to participate the Programming Competition Presentation Night and Prize Giving Ceremony and I won :D. Bwee~ I got the consolation prize (Merit) ^^. Well, I'm not the only one getting the prize, Choon Hui also gets the consolation prize (Distinction) as well ^^. So yeah I'm really proud.

Then on Sunday I've been joining Grace's party and it's pretty fun with tons of laughs. It's really a fun Sunday indeed.

As for today, I'm still having the CODS blues now :'(. Well… still learning how to cope with it actually. I'll read through the Friends pages when I had the time. I believe catching up 4 days worth of LJ friends entries is… uh… overwhelming.

Felix siging off now. (and hopefully my Internet is back by tonight)

[:: UPDATE ::]

- Yes my account is loaded so I'm able to be back online in no time ^^.
- Tons of new photos with me, will be posting them up later ^^b
- Yeah reading friends entries does lighten my mood ^^
