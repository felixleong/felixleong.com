It's hard to say how I feel today as there's going to be major future changes in our department. Well… It's not really major actually, but basically we might be shifting to another floor some time soon, although the details were yet to be confirmed. As much as everything is still uncertain just yet, but somehow I just feel that there'll be a possibility that yearns for my attention, but yet I can't tell what it actually is. It does worries me a lot somehow for quite some time until I reached home…

Anyway, I'm anticipating this challenge to arrive, and I guess the time has come for me to pursue what I have sought.
