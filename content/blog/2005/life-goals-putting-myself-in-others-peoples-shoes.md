Still learning how not to take things too personally in some situations, especially when it comes to minor things that goes against what I wished for or envisioned it to be. I understand that I shouldn't take my blessings for granted and I will learn how to put myself in other people's shoes and understand their needs and situation.

That implies that I also need to understand my obsessive-compulsive and (sometimes) selfish behaviour and make some necessary adjustment as well.

Sounds like a challenging task to meâ€¦ BRING IT ON!

**[:: NOTE ::]**

New section this time :). These "Life Goals" posts are essentially promises that I made to myself in the process of improve myself.

I have a small request to those who read this: If I violated these goals in anyway, you don't have to be kind to me: Do whatever neccessary to remind me about it, even it's going to be hurt me in the short-term.
