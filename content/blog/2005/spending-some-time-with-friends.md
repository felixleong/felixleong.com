And so now I have William, a friend who also doubles as my financial planner :pâ€¦ well, honestly, he already is my financial planner friend ever since last year XDDD. But I suppose I might be consulting him much more often, for one thing he knows the numbers more than I do :).

Just a recap of things, I asked William out today. Then later we chilled at his place with Max, who is also my friend during my university years. Most of the chatting we do is pretty much catching up with the news as well as discussing stuff. Then later I just relax myself with financial materials while Max spend time with his computer games.

Other than that, it's a pretty normal day. Learnt some PHP this morning so to prepare myself to develop my own website :). I'm hoping to get some of the basic framework done within a week or two. Then I'll be working hard on organizing my materials and working on graphical stuff. Once everything is done, it'll be hosting package shopping time :D. Hope that everything will go smoothly!
