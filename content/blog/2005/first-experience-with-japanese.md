Yesterday's recap:

- Still having some bumpy rides with my work as I'm still learning the in's and out's of the job. Still trying to get myself in sync with everything :). (guess that's what we call "working experience"? :p)
- Won Euromach 1 and The Best of Euromach 2001 from eBay! <3<3<3 The bad news is that it banged my budget (OK, they are really cheap, but my living expenses doesn't really have much room for me to spend much on entertainment) But I'm so looking forward to receiving them as I fell in love with the mixing of Euromach 1 (when I bought it for my friend) and the tracklist of Best of Euromach 2001 looks very promising (and with a lot of SCP goodness! :D)
- Aunt Maggie came for a visit today and she have brought a Japanese friend over as she was visiting Malaysia. She is very kind and soft lady with a very fair complexion which doesn't really shows any signs of age. She can't speak English very well though, and she used her electronic dictionary off and on to communicate with us. But apparently I do get a chance to talk to her in Japanese, but like her, I have to rely on my paperback Japanese dictionary. Guess my vocabulary does need a lot of practice before I can do strike any interesting conversation in Japanese. But basically it's a good experience to me. :)
- Just finished reading Zen and Japanese Culture today. I'm still thinking what book that I wanted to read next, currently it's really among The Leader In You by Dale Carnegie, the Chinese novelisation of Paradise Lost by John Milton, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and a bunch of classic fictions (Huck Finn, Black Beauty, Gulliver's Travels etc.). Hmmâ€¦. But honestly speaking, I really wonder whether I need a least some basic understanding about Christianity in order to make sense of Paradise Lost?
- The 6th Harry Potter book is going to be out soon *_*. I don't plan to buy it soon as I'm planning to get the paperback version, but GAH I need some way to avoid from any spoilers when it does get released!
