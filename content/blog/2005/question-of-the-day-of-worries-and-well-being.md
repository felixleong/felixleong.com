I'm feeling happy today, that's pretty much what I have to say regarding today. Somehow seeing the happiness in an environment and the smiles on the people around you are really irreplaceable and priceless. And the pride I had for my family has always gave me a lot of strength to go through a lot of hardships as well as making me proud for who I am and where I came from.

But somehow at this moment of extreme joy, for some reason that I'm a little bit concerned about the well being of others. Probably I'm just a worry-wart from the start, but somehow… to what extent that we should be concerned about others, especially when it comes to things that are outside your own reach of control or of those that involves past events? And where does this worry come from? Is it from a sincere concern towards others? Or is it just a fear -- of losing something that had brought happiness in our life? Or the fear that has connections with a painful past?

Hmm… at least thinking about it, whatever the outcome will be, I'll make sure to take enough preventive measures in the future. …Speaking of which, I guess this slight obsessive-compulsive behaviour does has its own effects.
