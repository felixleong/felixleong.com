{% mark post -%}For those who noticed, I have changed my LJ layout. It basically one the new S2 free templates that LJ provides with minor colour tweaks, but it essentially captures the general feeling that I am in now.

Honestly speaking one main reason for the change of layout is that I&apos;m starting to enter the transition into the fourth chapter in my life (or at least in my LJ sense). Every chapter actually signifies a turning point in life, in which one big turn of events really brought positive impact and changes into my life.

Reading back the poems in the past, it really shows the progress that I have been through thus far. Quoting back what I have written in the past:
"For those who didn&apos;t notice, my user info basically reflects a lot on myself… and the direction of my own life. My LJ is pretty much a record of my own journeys, which pretty much reflects on my own life from many aspects. And every single post has been done with a lot of heart and soul poured into every single word choice."

[from my LJ post on 21 November 2004 when I posted <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/felixleong/107362.html">Chapter 2</a> of my user info]

Thinking back:
Chapter 1 signifies the beginning of my LJ, which I believe that I&apos;ve been through one of the most depressing period when I started keeping my journal/diary. It is one of the period when I question a lot about life in general, and through LJ I have been receiving a lot of inputs in the forms of new thoughts, LJ friend comments, real-life stories of my online friends and a lot more. Through the expression of my own fragmented thoughts (or at least I perceive it to be fragmented) and viewpoints, I have gained a lot of crytallised insights and ideas.

My life have gone through a total shake up after getting to know some great friends (Ahmed, Allen and Choon Hui has to be the most significant three that comes into my mind instantly) and incidentally this period is one of the most exciting and dramatic experience in my own life that I will not forget.

Soon after, as if my experience has provided me with fertilized soil in my own being, Chapter 2 has seen some of the greatest growth. I have to say that this is one of my most passionate period when I start to explore new things and ideas. If Chapter 1 can be said to bring the greatest change internally, this period has seen more external change which greatly transforms my image and outlook in life.

I can daresay that it&apos;s a period of great hopes, that a great deal of idealism, optimism and passion has been infused in me. Although I do have to admit that I still have my depressing times as the transformation also brings a lot of starking contrasts in my own life.

And now, being in Chapter 3, I really can&apos;t say much about it. But in general I do feel as if life has taken its own course… it hard for me to explain this, but I feel as if things happen on its own accord. Although I&apos;m not really aware why this is happening, but I&apos;m greatly grateful and in debt with everyone who have participated in my life in one way or the other. And I really like to say "Thank you" to everyone.

Somehow I perceive this period (up until now) as a stable period in life, but I just have that feeling that this is going to change soon when I&apos;m entering the next chapter as I&apos;m starting to seek out more adventures and experiences in life. Honestly speaking I do get a bit nervous by the thoughts of it… but I&apos;m sure that whatever happens, it&apos;ll bring positive change in my life.
