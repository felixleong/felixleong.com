Felt much better right now. It does seems that there&apos;s a lot of things that I have been supressing in the past in the forms of self control, social conditionings and conjured fantasies (rated M by the ESRB)… and every supressed thoughts came to haunt me back to a point that really scares me: That it is possible for me to become insane and engage in violent behaviour.

Only that I realise that supression is also a human thought of a hidden intention, it&apos;s like a seed planted in our own thinking and eventually it&apos;ll grow and manifests in our own beings. And it will bring its effect later in life. And without notice, I have been caged into the darkness that I have created myself…

This really made me wonder… Is it that my fears aren&apos;t caused by others but created by my own self…?

Learning how to let go and readjust my own thoughts are definitely not easy. Guess I have to constantly remind myself… one step at a time… one step at a time.
