As said, probably death is only the end in the perception of our own dimension of physical reality… Come to think of it… What is actually lost in the event of one&apos;s death? Come to think about it, it&apos;s really a very interesting thought…

From my current line of thoughts, death can probably be viewed not as a lost of something physical in existence, but a lost of an illusionary dream/mind. OK, probably that&apos;s too abstract, putting it in an example: when someone/thing dies, the impact that it&apos;ll cause will only be determined by one&apos;s perception, value and importance of everything surrounding it. As humans, we often construct tons of mental perceptions towards those which are within our physical bounds of existence. This can mean a lot of things: A need, a desire, a dream, a perception, an image…

Thinking from that light, one&apos;s death doesn&apos;t really cause one cease to exist, but it&apos;ll cause these mental perceptions of the people surrounding it to crumble down. "What can a dead man do in the physical plane?" And that itself cause people to think that it&apos;s an end, but this end is only a perception from the "living" person&apos;s point of view but not of the "dead".

… Hmm… probably I believe that I would need to understand more about the human ego and the "presence" of one&apos;s being in existence (I used your terminology, but it&apos;s a good word choice indeed :D).

P/S: I just notice that the "XO" smiley kinda resembles a symbol that can be interpreted as provided that two tangent lines being drawn on a circle being drawn close enough to each other and long enough, there&apos;s a possibility that two tangent lines will cross each other.

That itself has quite a deep philosophical meaning on it&apos;s own ;). (and probably it can also make a good math joke :p){%- endmark %}
