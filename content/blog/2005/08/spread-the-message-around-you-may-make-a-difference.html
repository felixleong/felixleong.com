Ganked from pawsrpg:

I could be the girl kicked out of her home because I confided in my mother that I am a lesbian.
I could be the prostitute working the streets because nobody will hire a transsexual woman.
I could be the sister who holds her gay brother tight through the painful, tear-filled nights.
We could be the parents who buried our daughter long before her time.

I could be the man who died alone in the hospital because they would not let my partner of twenty-seven years into the room.

I could be the foster child who wakes up with nightmares of being taken away from the two fathers who are the only loving family I have ever had. I wish they could adopt me.

I could be one of the lucky ones, I guess. I survived the attack that left me in a coma for three weeks, and in another year I will probably be able to walk again.
I could be one of the unlucky ones. I killed myself just weeks before graduating high school. It was simply too much to bear.

We could be the couple who had the realtor hang up on us when she found out we wanted to rent a one-bedroom for two men.
I could be the person who never knows which bathroom I should use if I want to avoid getting the management called on me.

I could be the mother who is not allowed to even visit the children I bore, nursed, and raised. The court says I am an unfit mother because I now live with another woman.
I could be the domestic-violence survivor who found the support system grow suddenly cold and distant when they found out my abusive partner is also a woman.

I could be the domestic-violence survivor who has no support system to turn to because I am male.
I could be the father who has never hugged his son because I grew up afraid to show affection to other men.
I could be the home-economics teacher who always wanted to teach gym until someone told me that only lesbians do that.

I could be the man who died when the paramedics stopped treating me as soon as they realized I was transsexual.
I could be the person who feels guilty because I think I could be a much better person if I didnâ€™t have to always deal with society hating me.
I could be the man who stopped attending church, not because I don&apos;t believe, but because they closed their doors to my kind.

I could be the person who has to hide what this world needs most, love.

Repost this if you belive homophobia is wrong.
