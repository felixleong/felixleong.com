{% mark post -%}孤寂的夜里，
悸动的心
呼唤着！哭嚎着！
有谁听得见吗？

心中的坚强与虚弱
似乎只是幻影
或许那只是
编织借口的工具吧！

是不甘心吗？
那不甘寂寞的呼唤吗？
还是
那是紧急求救的苦嚎？

苦苦挣扎…
累得不能自己
就这样继续沉睡
等待着明天的天晓

这个夜里
剩下
脸上枯干的痕迹，
犹如祈祷的心跳声…

In a lonely night,
This trembling heart
Calling! Crying!
Does anyone hears it?

That strength and weakness of the heart
Seem to be an illusion
Maybe that&apos;s only
A tool to weave more excuses

Is it that I&apos;m not content?
That it is a scream of non-content because of loneliness?
Or
That is an emergency cry for help?

Struggling hard…
Tired to a point when my will is powerless against my soul
And so I continue to slumber
Until the dawn of tommorrow

This night,
All&apos;s left
The trace of dryness on my cheeks,
The heartbeat that sounds like a prayer…{%- endmark %}
