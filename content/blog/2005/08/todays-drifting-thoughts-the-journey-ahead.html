From time-to-time,
I couldn&apos;t stop looking back
from where I have been

With awe,
I see the path
on which I have travelled

Looking forward,
I see the path ahead
With awe,
I see vastness

And then,
With hesitation,
My body goes a-trembling…

…

That pretty much how I feel now… I can&apos;t really finish or polish it just yet as I really have no idea what is going to be ahead on me. (and it&apos;s been a while since I last write poems and stuff, meh…)

Guess I might as well resume with my own plans and work.
