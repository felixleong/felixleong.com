Didn&apos;t update yesterday as I&apos;m not really in the mood of typing my entry :(. Anyway, the important thing now is that I&apos;m feeling much better now.

Anyway, Eurobeat Disney 3 and Aerobeat Dance Pop Version 2 came in the mail two days ago :D. Although first impression wise, Eurobeat Disney 3 sounds very lackluster to me as those Eurobeat artists sounds strangled from their powerful vocals (especially Mickey B., poor thing :( ). But it does sounds OK after a few runs. Aerobeat Dance Pop Version 2 on the other hand sounds good :D, it doesn&apos;t have those really mismatching and annoying soundeffects that Aerobeat Eurobeat has, so that&apos;s a big plus for them :). (Although they do inject a lot of extra sound effects like vynil scratching, all those "Heys~~~", "Hoo~~~" and other male wailing overused in dance tunes, but everything is used appropriately :p)

Got this from maryssa:

You have the need to<br />satisfy your inner gangster as you mingle with<br />Tokyo&apos;s underworld.  However, you do show<br />shades of being hip and fashionable, and are<br />not afraid to have fun.  Welcome to Tokyo&apos;s<br />most dangerous borough, now good luck avoiding<br />the cops.
