Originally posted as a comment in my friend&apos;s blog, but I just think that I want to keep a copy here:

A lot of times, it really depends on how you look at things: What are you thinking when you are climbing a mountain? Is it to conquer the mountain? Is it to prove the strength of oneself? Or is it just to explore and enjoy the journey?

Life is always a continuous journey of different destinations at different times. And what guides you through is your own decisions that you make in due course of time.

Just enjoy the journey! Enjoy the present moment and don&apos;t look back with regrets. Then it&apos;s possible to feel youthful again even after the journey back from the mountain tops :).

Sometimes whether I write these kind of comments for myself or others :p, but it doesn&apos;t matter anyway :).
