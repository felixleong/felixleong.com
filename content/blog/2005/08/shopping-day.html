Today not only marks one of the most important days in Malaysia: The day of her independence, it also marks the end of this month&apos;s nation wide mega sales carnival. And the despite the fact that I&apos;m getting myself into high waters (and mind you that I said that with the fact that I <b>just</b> received my pay check, which is definitely enough to ring a lot of panic alarms), I went out today for some, um… last day bargain shopping spree XD.

Anyway, I only bought stuff for my fitness commitment: I definitely need tracksuits as I <b>never</b> actually own any of them up until now XD. So for the time being, I got myself some three-quarter length sport pants (Note: Umm… does anyone know what these pants are actually called? ^^"), a new pair of shoes (my old pair is now in a very sorry state ^^"), a shoe bag (I <b>really</b> hope that the fitness club would be generous enough to give us one… or probably that needs some pestering :p) and last but not least… the humble padlock. Hmm… this really makes me feel geared up tomorrow ;).

I also got myself Stephen R. Covey&apos;s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, which will be the book of the week ;). Honestly I didn&apos;t thought of buying that book, but luck has it that I manage to "borrow" (without permission though XD) from a neighbour and I was determined to get it ASAP just after I barely reached page 30. The foreword and introduction talks a lot about a lot of fundamental things about human perception and paradigm shift, which I finding myself nodding my head energetically… I can probably say that it really expresses my own personal views and experience! So for those who haven&apos;t read the book, I really encourage you to borrow it from somebody and read at least until page 50. I&apos;m currently reading it through, but I&apos;m absolutely sure that it&apos;s a good book to keep in your bookshelf!

But probably the only nag I have about it now is that it just seems that all self-help books, regardless of whichever topic it covers, are essentially the same thing -- and that the only difference is that how these ideas are conveyed and expressed ^^". But then again, I guess it doesn&apos;t harm to get ourselves reminded of these principles from time to time ;).
