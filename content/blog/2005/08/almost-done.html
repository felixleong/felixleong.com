After a whole day of marathoning The Count of Monte Cristo, I&apos;m just need to complete the last, climatic 100 pages of reading. And damn this has to be one of the longest novel I have read since The Lord of The Rings as I&apos;m reading the original, English translated version of the novel which spans about 1100 pages (including the translation notes) in 7.5 pt font. O_O||

But anyway, it&apos;s really a good read :). Although I do have to say that the heavy references of the French Revolution really put me off initially (I admit the fact that I really suck in history, in fact I have almost forgotten all historical facts that I can muster :p. And as an additional mention, this is my second attempt to "conquer" this novel).

I guess I&apos;ll revert back to some lighter reading material before I attempt thsee heavyweight stuff.
