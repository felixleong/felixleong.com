Let&apos;s see…

Surprisingly, the haze is getting worse around here :(. That really makes me feel sad because I miss fresh air.

Surprisingly, I find myself expanding my musical horizons as I started to listen to pop in <b>English</b>. XDDD I used to think that American music is a bit… uninspiring, but now I&apos;m starting to love it :). Guess it&apos;s really refreshing to take a break away from tons of Eurobeat and JPop :).

Surprisingly, I found myself having my budget boomed at the <b>beginning</b> of the month O_O"

Surprisingly, I <b>got my book prize cheque</b> :D! (Joys of being academically successful :p) That really saved the day.

In other news, I just collected my degree certificate and my stage photo. And surprisingly they looked quite nice :) (well… definitely not my best photo shots).
