This is going to be the current design for blue::brain, which will be part of FelixLeong.com as a personal blog site:

(Note: The measurements are **very** approximated when I did this. And "Other **Sides**" is not a typo, because eventually this whole project will be called "Sides of Felix Leong" as a whole)

FelixLeong.com is really a big scale project to me as I'm not creating only one, but four different sites: PEDAGOGIES (my manga drawing and tutorial site), blue::brain (my blog), Tech Scribble (my programming and technical resource and tutorial site) and ParaGroove (my parapara site). Probably it'll take me about 5 months to a year to actually complete them all.

That will be my current goal.
