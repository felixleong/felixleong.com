<strong>March 2005 - Stress And Sickness</strong>

Nothing much to say about this month as I spent more time <strike>working</strike> rushing on my final year project. And apparently with the stress level builds up, my health condition goes down the slope. :( A definite BLEH in my books. But I'm glad enough that I managed to pull the thesis off, however later on I'm pulled from 10 directions with the assignments and mid-terms that follows that.

During that month as well, I also ironed out the things I needed to do in order to start work as soon as I graduate. Exciting experience, yes, as well as kind of nervous as well, as it turns out to be, well… going too smoothly than I expected. I'm just grateful that I was given the chance to be in the team :).

March also signifies the beginning of my exploration in the spiritual realm… well, sort of, in an indirect way.

… And apparently not in this month either, as my modem got electrocuted by thunder storms. But it really gave me a fresh change as I find myself spending more time doing something else with the temporary absence of the Internet.

This month is pretty much piecing everything together as my university life is drawing a close. A lot of time spent with friends, old and new, as we cherish the time that we are together. In this month, Steven and Theen Gee moved in for a few months (Steven stayed only for a month, as he's going to work in Singapore after he graduated) The presence of Theen Gee is definitely a great blessing, in a way, and it didn't took long for us to become close friends. We have great times, just sitting in the room talking about everything in life. It's been quite some time I haven't been having such deep, thought provoking and insightful discussion about almost everything.

As I progress towards the end of the month, I wrapped up all my presentation, job application stuff as well as the final examinations. Everything goes pretty smoothly, probably the most agonising moments (i.e. preparation) had really trained me hard? Hmm… And as time goes by and towards the end of the month, I finally "graduated"… well, unofficially :p. But I have full confidence that I'll pass my papers anyway :p.

And what's next is that I'm preparing myself to face the next change in life: being in the workplace. During that time, I still remembered how anxious and nervous I was as the thought of tons of new experiences really daunts me a little.
