{% mark post -%}It's this time of the year again, it's just a good time to review what's happening in my life as recorded in my LJ. Say it like a summary of sorts, and I have tagged some extra posts, particularly I have expanded some posts into the impromptu section.

Anyway, 2005 has been a very exciting year for me as I find myself changed quite a lot during this period. A lot of joy, laughter, blood and tears happened, and it was quite a turbulent year for myself as I have experienced both the peaks and the valleys in life. But it really made me being able to realise a lot of things that I have overlooked in the past, that as much isn't a bed of roses, it wasn't a bed of thorns either: It's a combination of both which gives us the right environment for us to grow and be strong.

… And that… without what I have been through, I wouldn't have known what is it be to live my own life.

OK, enough of that: Prepare for the longest entry I ever typed up until now! …probably not :p, as I planned to make it a six parter, just that I try to complete it by today or tomorrow :).

<strong>January 2005 -- The External Transformation Begins</strong>

The Felix Makeover BEGINS! :D Basically the whole month is about making a 180 degree turn in terms of my appearance when I spent a lot of time, money and effort. It's basically started when I planned to "shock" everybody during the Chinese New Year, but it really had changed me completely. Basically my physical appearance that I had now all starts from there.

And I believe starting from that time, I started to fool around with my digital camera and shared tons of pictures, showing fragments of what I have seen and part of my own personal life.

Then, it's me winning the <a href="http://www.genting.com.my/rnd/2004/index.htm">eGenting Programming Competition 2004</a>, which apparently is my stepping stone towards my own working life as I entered the department with that qualification.

In terms of emotional development, somehow I was still recovering from the pains that I have experienced in the past: Bean, Choon Hui and Erika. But it really starts to open the window for me to explore my own viewpoints in relationship and love.

… And more down to earth, back at school, I'm starting to struggle with my final year project, and I started to attend Japanese classes :).

Speaking of which… I did done a review of the year 2004 in my life. But I never got round to complete it, but anyway.

February isn't really a very high month to me, as I have been into some emotional lows as I feel the intense pain as I started my journey in seeking the meaning of love.

On a lighter note, my makeover plans really made an impact: The fire and ice style does really shout for themselves :p. It also a time when I start to take Japanese more seriously, and I completed the basic Japanese course on that month as well.

And it's probably the month when my music CD collection expands exponentially, especially my Eurobeat CD collection. But I also started to expand my own exposure in different genres.
