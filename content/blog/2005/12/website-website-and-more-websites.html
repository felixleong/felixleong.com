Been spending days maintaining websites of my own. It's been a while I finally made my move, having myself being unproductive for quite some time.

Anyway, currently starting work for FelixLeong.com, in which I started migrating The Digital Blue Wave (my technical blog) over to my server and starting やっぱり！の世界で (Yappari! no Sekai de), my own blog which is going to be a much light-hearted blog in Japanese, considering my skills in Japanese dead limited to write anything serious XDDDD. Seems to me like it's going to be a good complement to my LJ.

In other news, I have been updating my personal profile over Friendster:
http://www.friendster.com/profiles/felixleong

For those who are interested can go over and have a look at it ;). It's still a work-in-progress while I'm trying to string together a complete profile which reflects the reality of myself well. :)

I could use with some testimonials, though :p.

(P/S: For those who have a Friendster account and wanted to add me as a friend, feel free to add me using the email address seh_hui (at) yahoo.com

Anyway, it's back to my busy, busy day.
