{% mark post -%}Today can be described with only a few words: Tall stack of paperwork, pending workload (that keeps on coming my way) and a flat tyre.

But working on my own website shifts my energies back in shape. Just merged all the important posts in my technical blog, <a href="http://thedigitalbluewave.felixleong.com/">The Digital Blue Wave</a>. It's been hard work migrating it over to my personal site, <a href="http://www.felixleong.com/">FelixLeong.com</a>, but now with all the contents moved over, I can spend time working on other stuff.

First things first: Get rid of that default template XD.{%- endmark %}
