{% mark post -%}或许…永远永远没有人会看得到…  
或许…永远永远没有人会听得见…  
或许…永远永远没有人会感受得到…

但是，自己仍然默默地期许着  
…一天，心中的温暖能够传达到你那边。  
虽然有时还会觉得低落…  
虽然有时还会觉得创伤…  
虽然有时还会觉得绝望…

但现在，我终于发觉到：  
即使你永远永远没注意到，也没什么关系了：  
因为你的存在已经让我找到我最珍贵的宝物了。  
我终于可以实实在在的相信爱的存在了。

现在心中吟唱着的歌是我生存的证明：  
因为你，也为了你，分享那份喜悦。  
…继续地祈祷着…  
…希望你会感受得到…

Maybe… Forever and ever nobody will be able to see…  
Maybe… Forever and ever nobody will be able to hear…  
Maybe… Forever and ever nobody will be able to feel…

But, I still silently wished  
… that one day, the warmth in my heart will be able to reach you.  
Although sometimes I still feel down…  
Although sometimes I still feel hurt…  
Although sometimes I still feel hopeless…

But now, I finally realised:  
Even forever and ever you will never notice, it's not a problem anymore:  
Because your existence has made me found my greatest treasure.  
I finally can believe the existence of love with no doubts.

Now, the songs sung from the heart is proof of my life:  
Because of you, and is for you, to share that joys in me.  
… Continuing to pray…  
… Wishing that you'll be able to feel it…{%- endmark %}
