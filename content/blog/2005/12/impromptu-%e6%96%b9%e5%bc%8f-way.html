{% mark post -%}很多时候，会觉得爱很痛苦。
为何呢？
其实就是很多时候，就只会希望别人怎样去爱自己，但却没去细心观察对方爱的表现和方式。

就因为他爱你的表现和方式和自己想象中不一样…所以让自己或双方受伤，那又何必呢…？

原来，爱…就是那么的一回事。

A lot of times, I feel love is painful.
Why?
Because a lot of times, I only know how to wish how others should love me, but I never observed carefully the way others express their love.

Just because the way others love you is different from what you have expected… And causing pain to oneself or with the other, is that really worth it?

Love… is something like that.{%- endmark %}
