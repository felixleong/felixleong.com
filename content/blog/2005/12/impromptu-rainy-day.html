心情似乎像天气一样：一时放晴，一阵下雨。

不知为何，今天天气预报似乎没料到现在心中那阵微微细雨。真想想寻找一个温暖的停留站歇歇下。:)

(My) Feelings seems to be like the weather: Sometimes it shines, sometimes it showers.

I don't know why, it seems that the weather forecast today didn't predicted that drizzling in my heart. Really makes me wanted to find a warm place to rest for a while. :)
