Isn't this cute? &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;

Anyway, full story: We have a small (pre-)Christmas party in the office today, and we have agreed to do an exchange of gifts at the end of the party. And so~ we ordered Domino's pizza and have a fun time listening to Christmas songs and such.

Our gift exchange is pretty much determined by random, as we draw numbered lots to see which present we are going to take home :). I got this cute keyboard wrist cushion from Hui Ying :D. It's so adorable that I couldn't resist hugging it or something :p.

Highlighted gift of the day is definitely:
- A ladle, from Seck Min to Boon Yeow
- A potty full of jelly, from Francis to Seng Yaw XDDD.

Oh god I laughed so badly at that time XDDD. Anyway, here are a few pictures to share:

This is my gift: a hook andâ€¦ something that fix your cables on the table. received by Francis. And it is the same design series with the cute kitty I had now *^-^*
