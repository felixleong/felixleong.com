{% mark post -%}今天心情似乎布满了乌云：心中觉得沉重，却下不了雨来的感觉。

还蛮混淆的，即觉得心中沉重难堪，却并不觉得悲伤或讨厌。

是一向来对你累积却表达不到的感觉吗…？

真的很想说“我爱你”，但自己实在很不希望在心中在这种天气说出口…

My emotions today seems to be blanketed by clouds: Feeling heavy inside, yet it doesn't seem to be capable to rain.

It's quite confusing actually, even if I feel some heavy and burdened inside, but I don't feel sad or annoyed by it.

Is it the accumulated feelings for you that never get expressed?

Really wanted to say "I love you", but I really don't want to say it under such emotional weather…{%- endmark %}
