{% mark post -%}If everything goes as what my calendar (future events, as in) and bank balance is stating now, I'll be broke before end of this month.

Scary thought, but that does mean that I need to monitor my finances more carefully this month… make that EXTREMELY careful.

Other than that, I'm now <b>almost</b> officially capable to run into debt (read: credit cards). That's one more parameter for me to keep track now, but at least I did had my reality check before hand when I saw the interest rates (18% for late payment, around 9% p.a. for any flexible payment scheme).

I guess that there's no wonder that they say that money is easily spent than earned… at least I see that <b>theoretically</b>. Currently I'm thinking of a catch phrase to be stuck on my credit card (if my application is approved) to remind me of spending wisely.

Other than that, it'd be a very interesting financial challenge in the future. Wait until car and home loans comes into the picture. *shivers*{%- endmark %}
