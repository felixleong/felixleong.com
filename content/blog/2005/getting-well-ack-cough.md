My immune systems are still battling hard with those pesky gremlins in me. Currently I still feel an infection in my throat, most probably either due to allergens (*pesticides… ugh*) or too much of heaty stuff (too much chocolate, for starters). It's getting better now, expect for the phlegm that gets into my throat occasionally.

In other news… well~ I'm currently employed ^^. Well, sort of :p. Anyway, I just got a phone call from a company which I really wanted to work with and they offered me for a job ^^b. Squee~~ So provided that I MAKE SURE (square that) that I don't flunk this semester and I'll be off working as soon as I finished my finals ^^. So now I just need to get a few papers signed and I'll be officially be on duty starting this May.

Yay! That gives me enough motivation to work harder this semester :D.

As much I *didn't* live in Canada:
