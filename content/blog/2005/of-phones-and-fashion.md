All the while I have been complaining that my phone is getting a bit wonky sometimes, so I decided to go to the service centre and get that fixed. Luckily it was done promptly. Hopefully it'll solve the problem or I would need to go to there again :(.

Initially I was thinking of buying the two sets of new clothings for Chinese New Year, but I can't seem to know which one suits me better so I'm thinking of delaying it later so that I can pick them up with Erika, or probably with some other girls if she can't make it (hopefully, since she is responsible for picking my specs :) ). But then again, I don't think I know many girl friends in my university.

I'm not really decided yet, but I'm thinking of using the fire and ice concept for this year. Which means that I would get two totally contrasting sets of clothes, the fire set would be a much more daring, breaking out of my traditional clothes, funky style; while the ice set would be much more focused on maturity, or probably the calmer side of myself without sacrificing any style factor.

Currently I'm thinking of getting:

- Long sleeves shirt, probably white or plain coloured
- Matching tees or shirt to go with it
- One set of jeans, but probably traditional ones but with cool cuttings and fabric (I personally don't really like washed out colours or any flashy patches on it, because it would be hard to match them with)
- And one long pants like Kyou (Fruitbasket :p) had, with two straps dangling on each side. I saw one on Shibuya fashion store :3.

Probably I would go for this <span style="color: #f9066d">red (for fire)</span> and this <span style="color: #48e405">green (for ice)</span> [sorry because I really sucked in colour names XDDD]. I really like this ones that Giodarno shows in one of their posters, but I was wondering whether I would want to pick that combo because probably most people would have stole that idea in the first place :p.

I'm currently aiming on a below RM250 budget, which is pretty muchâ€¦ well, a tall order since usually long sleeves shirt and the pants would really cost a lot. But then again my parents would scream if they know that I spent more than that for clothes ^^".

Anyway, do expect a Felix Makeover 2005 post once I'm done with the shopping ^^. Cause I'll totally make sure that I'll break my usual fashion code ;). (and I would ask my friend to make sure that they are sexy before they EVER approve them ;p)
