title: When Emptiness Starts to Kick In

For the past few days, I haven't been feeling extremely well… it's like, I'm feeling some sort of emptiness that is started to engulf me… I wouldn't say that it was depression, but it seems that it has potential to bring depression in. Sometime I do wonder though, this emptiness seems to be extremely neutral… it's like… you can't say that it was good and bad, it's depends on how you look at it that matters. But then again… I really can't see how can I take this positively…

Anyway… been overspending lately, I don't know, somehow it did seem that buying things seems to be an escapist activity to me (at least from what I perceive it, anyway). But then again, it's really hard to resist JPop CDs for RM5 :p. Just bought Namie Amuro's GENIUS 2000, Aikawa Nanase's Purana and Yuzu's Yuzuen. All for RM5. :p

Also I got myself a hairdryer… and there're tons of CDs that I'm bidding over eBay.

What else… … I need a hug ;\_\_\_\_;.
