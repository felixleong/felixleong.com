There are a few things that has definitely gone wrong somewhere that I really have to adjust myself. Can't always keep myself in such a mess all the time, neh?

Anyway, I finally got the chance to tell Tommy that I quit from MYPPF. Well… just say that we have different views and direction on how MYPPF should be managed. And it's much better that he don't have to be restricted and he now has more room to do his stuff to promote parapara. As for me, I think I'll just focus on what I do best: promoting parapara through the Internet :p. I'm still planning my ParaGroove! (tentative) website, I'm thinking of making it a multi-lingual site like how Jason and Dom did. Most likely it'll be in English, Chinese and Japanese… well, if I manage to learn my Japanese well, that is XDDD.

As for my internal anguish/jealousy/whatever-that-is-negative… I'm learning to let things go, in a way. Somehow, I have been building too much fantasies of my own that I have overdwelled myself in… As those illusions crumble down to make way for reality, I'm starting to feel afraid… that things would definitely don't go the way I wanted.

Well… I suppose that there's always a square one to step on :p.

Anyway… still learning to deal with life. :)

Oh yea! By the way, got myself another commitment: my own Internet real estate :D! Just bought 1G of space from Sze Hau :D. Anyway, I'm planning to host my parapara site up there, just that I need my videos up there. Can anyone who has my filmed videos help me out? Because it's gonna kill my 56K if I do it myself :).
