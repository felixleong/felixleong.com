There's no doubt that Final Fantasy VI still is the best Final Fantasy in my own opinion. Beatifully composed music (in fact it is FFVI which brought me into the world of game music), great battle system, cool graphics (well… in the SNES era, anyway)… And the best thing I liked about it is no doubt the storyline and its line of extremely great characters.

I still remember the many great moments of Final Fantasy VI, going through the game, I get so immersed into its beautifully crafted plotline that there's never one moment that I will forget. The laughter, the tears, the tension… everything is etched so deep down.

Now I'm replaying the game again. It's really fun revisiting all the characters that I loved very much. Especially Tina (Japanese version)/Terra (English version) and Celes. Well… hopefully I'm able to have enough cash to buy FF Anthology, the OST and the classical remix album "Grand Finale".

Expect more FF6 thoughts later.
