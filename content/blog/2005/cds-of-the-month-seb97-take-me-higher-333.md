OMG! These came into the mail today <333

These two albums mean a lot to me as I remembered that my first favourite Eurobeat artist is Dave Rodgers, and the bonus disc of SEB97 has the most powerful Eurobeat tunes in extended format! :D (Cherry's Yesterday <333) I guess I'll be having my headphones on for quite some time these days :).

Anyway, today's maryadavies birthday! :D All my best wishes for the coming years to you! :)
