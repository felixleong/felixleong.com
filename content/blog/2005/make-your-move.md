Yes! It's been a while I have choreographed any paras :D. And finally it seems that a sudden gush of creativity has come to me :D -- Not to mention the blinding speed that I'm able to complete it :D.

It's likeâ€¦ a day or two before I finished choreo'ing Sophie's Are You Ready To Fly in an hour or two. And today I just finished with Van T.K. and Kiki & Fancy's Make Your Move in a day! And I'm really proud of them as I have pretty much break the traditional pattern and incorporated something new in it :D.

And I can say that it is better than my last set (I Wanna Be Fat, Hello and Wings To The Sky) :D.

I'll do my filming this weekend. Till then, I'll be practising it until I got the moves just right.

*(Note: I'm sure Ahmed's going to love Make Your Move ;) )*
