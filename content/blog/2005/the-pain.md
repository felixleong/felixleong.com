*"Behind these beautiful gates, are we locking ourselves in? Or are we locking ourselves out?"*

No matter how hard I tried, I can't seem to bear the pain deep inside. The tears which has been contained seem to have a leak somewhere that it flows down uncontrollably.

… Do I deserve all this pain? Now I really don't know whether they are caused by others or by myself…

… I wish I knew the answer…
