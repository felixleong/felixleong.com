Woa~ Time does flies :). I'll be reporting for work tomorrow. Kinda nervous actually.

Yesterday has been a little bit tiring as I shop for formal working clothes (you know, shirts and slacks). As I shop for them, I'm kinda tempted to get some really sexy undies to go with it, but I held back after reassessing my wallet :p. Probably I'll get them next time :).

Guess that's pretty much it. I'm hoping the best for tomorrow :).
