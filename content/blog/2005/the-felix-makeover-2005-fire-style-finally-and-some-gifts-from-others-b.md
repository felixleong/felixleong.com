Honestly I'm totally beat when I'm on my way home, but Erika asked me out since she said that she won't be free tomorrow to shop for my clothes. And so I went out. Honestly speaking my mood isn't really good, still feeling heavy because of the CODS but I went anyway. But it turns out to be much more of an awkward situation because I kept my silence for the first half of the shopping trip. But I'm glad she took me out in the first place because I do have fun after this ^^.

But luckily the pants in Soda's bargain bin seems to catch my eye and it only took me 30 minutes or so to complete my Fire style for Chinese New Year ^^b. But honestly speaking, thinking back of the description of my ideal concept for Fire and Ice style, somewhat it just seems that my Ice style seems to have a much more drastic change than what I had for Fire XDDD. But nonetheless I got two contrasting sets of clothes which looks extremely cool on me ^^. Anyway, the list for my Fire style:

- Soda's black pants [RM49]. I love the fabric <333, but I really don't know what it is made of since the label didn't mention anything about it. It's really comfy to wear, the cuttings are pretty much simplistic (or should I say that there's nothing fancy about it), but I really love the pants <33.
- Soda's umm… blouse? XDDD [RM55.20]. No kidding, that's what it wrote on the my receipt for the red shirt XD. Ah~ anyway :p.
- White belt from Tropicana Life [RM27]. Well… since I didn't own a white belt XD. But it looked pretty cool, as much it was pretty much hidden

So here's a picture of it:

And oh yeah! I promised that I'll take a photo of Erika's birthday present to me and this is how the outfit looks like:

OK, I'm feeling a bit tired right now and I'm a bit sleepy, so do excuse me for a while *yawn*. Enjoy the rest of the photos (and more to come tomorrow!)

One of my friends represented our University to participate in a competition (Basketball, I believe) in Indonesia and she gave me a really cool pen as a souvenir <333
