{% mark post -%}<strong>~ #3 ~</strong>  
Running away  
On a lost path  
Without an end  
in sight

A unknown shadow  
Creeping;  
An instinct  
<em>"to escape from…?"</em>

<strong>~ #2 ~</strong>  
Remembering  
A distant past  
with a vision  
so bright

A weary soul  
Limping;  
Forgotten  
<em>"that I'm trying"</em>

<strong>~ #1 ~</strong>  
Approaching  
The ominous shadow  
with a terror  
unable to subside

A frozen pair of eyes  
staring;  
timidly asking  
<em>"What is it"</em>

<strong>~ #0 ~</strong>  
Engulfing,  
or so it seemed  
Yet left nothing  
in sight

A clueless soul  
Trembling;  
Forgetting  
<em>"…."</em>{%- endmark %}
