Together with that, the responsibility not only to yourself but the livelihood of the ones dependent on you.

And as we progress in life, inevitably our signatures carries more and more weight - with each stroke of the pen could potentially bind you into bigger and bigger responsibilities. Mainly legal documents that not only declares the proper ownership but also together with it the unknown opportunities and burdens that arise from such properties.

Imagine this: employment contracts, marriage registration documents, S&amp;P to your new home, loan documentsâ€¦

And that being human, some of us (myself included) have the fear of potential loss - a psychological barrier that we fear to thread. As we look upon the dotted lines, the brain would conjure up a whole list of worst-case disasters that could potentially arise from such legal bindings. And the next thing we know is that the pen I'm holding may have been quivering without me consciously knowing that it happened.

I'm starting to be able to empathize how Peter Pan feels - however, in a world where Neverland never exists, putting oneself in complete denial wouldn't make these legal structures go away.
