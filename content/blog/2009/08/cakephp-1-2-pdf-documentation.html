Just recently looked into <a title="CakePHP Framework homepage" href="http://cakephp.org/" target="_blank">CakePHP</a> as well, as I find it to be one of the easier to use MVC frameworks for PHP and that <a title="CakePHP manual" href="http://book.cakephp.org/" target="_blank">the manual</a> is really well written.

And, as usual, I do prefer to have offline documentation so I don't have to find myself paralysed when I'm developing on a computer without an Internet connection (which is also a good way to cut off distractions :-)). Luckily, CakePHP does offer such a means by <a title="CakePHP manual: All-in-one page" href="http://book.cakephp.org/complete/3" target="_blank">giving an option to view the whole manual in one page</a>.

One gripe though: printing the page itself sucks: The text so small it's kind of unreadable and I couldn't tell the headings apart from the text. It's really annoying when I wanted a few printed pages so that I'd refer to them in some physical form (read up the tutorial while I'm on a train, for example).

So what I did is spend some time working on the print CSS and make it pretty enough to be readable and usable by my standards. As much as I wished the page numbers aren't that close to the bottom margin, well, it's Firefox's fault :p. The PDF is generated using <a title="PrimoPDF" href="http://www.primopdf.com/" target="_blank">PrimoPDF</a> and you can preview and download the manual from the <a title="Scribd" href="http://scribd.com/" target="_blank">Scribd</a> applet below:
