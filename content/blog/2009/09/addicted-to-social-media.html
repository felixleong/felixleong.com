I have a confession to make: I'm starting to notice my addiction for social sites. Mainly Facebook and Twitter. There's just something about these two sites really. I'd personally would say that they are like sirens which seduces Internet surfers who pass by their territory, drawing them into a blackhole that sucks out the time and energy out of them.

I'm not condemning these two sites by all means, in fact I appreciated the fact they do open up a window of opportunity to get access into the minds, knowledge and social interactions of people I find interesting and admirable.

Just needed to remind myself as common sense goes: take everything in moderation.{%- endmark %}
