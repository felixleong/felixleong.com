What happens when you need to find your own filing cabinet among a sea of hundreds of them?

Worse, they are all arranged closely together: meaning you have to pull them out one by one if you are unlucky to have yours in the deep end of the sea of cabinets.

Even worse, you notice that all labels are stuck in the front and the only way you are going to find yours is to move them out one at a time.

Worst of them allâ€¦ these things are heavy.

That's the most amusing experience I got when I moved into the new office (or rather my second coming :p) today.
