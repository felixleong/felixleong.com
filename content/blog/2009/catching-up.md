As you are reading this, I'd probably attended a friend's wedding back into my hometown - as I had scheduled this post a few days back.

As I'm writing this, it really reminds me of the early days when I started my web log back in LiveJournal. And that was the time when I post pretty much on a daily basis on what's going on with my life and all the thoughts that had been wandering in my head for sometimes.

And at times when people whom I haven't met for a long time starts to ask me how am I doing, I usually answer them with a slight bit of pride that they can always read my blog and proceed to gave them the URL. And I can't really remembered how the conversations went on after that.

Fast forward five years to the present, I revisited and pondered about my behaviour. I'm pretty sure what's going on in my head at that time: that I personally find it tiring giving out pre-canned answers repeatedly to the same questions and that if people cared about my recent endeavours, they could just check it up on my blog.

Looking at it now, I wondered whether I'm too idealistic on the efficiency of humans keeping up with the latest events within his/her social circle. It turns out that most people like myself are pretty much completely occupied with our own lives that we can't keep up with the news of every person that we had met throughout our lifetimes.

Hence the tradition of asking “how do you do?”: that the only way we could ever reconnect ourselves and bridging our communication channels. Hence that idealism of mine not only indirectly alienates my acquaintances, it also robs away the possibility of catching up and sharing experiences in life, relishing the short time that we'll be together again.

So, by the time you'd read this, I'd probably had my opportunity to meet up with a lot of my old classmates - some of them which I have known since the first day in primary school. Hopefully after all the toasting to the newly-weds and enjoying the sumptuous dinner (as per Chinese tradition), I would have learn a bit about enjoying small talks that I'd had there.
