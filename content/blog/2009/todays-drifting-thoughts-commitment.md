Eight months ago, I agonized myself with the thought of car ownership. It wasn't a particularly pleasant experience as there's two "blocker" thoughts that runs uncomfortably through my veins: the negative connotation of carrying debt (I was effectively debt-free at that point of time) and the fear of driving. Both of these things literally shrink my balls (ahem, being a guy, guess that's the best illustration of how I felt :p), but in the end, I managed to get away with it.

Fast forward eight months later, as in now, I find myself revisiting the topic of credit, and of a bigger scale, no less.

You see, with my recent decision to move back to Kuala Lumpur, I was presented with an overwhelming amount of options: each with its own set of merits and tradeoffs. And at this present stage, a whole new option is open to me: the option to buy my own home. That's really a completely foreign territory which my brain is still having a rough time absorbing.

With so many parameters in making a decision which I'm totally clueless about, keeping a cool head is the one thing I really need at the moment.

â€¦ Now, what was I talking about from the start? Oh, the car. Seemed that the I've already reached a stage which I'm already capable of taking up bigger financial commitments, I guess the better response would be to pat myself at the back? The things that mattered now are to get out from yet another comfort zone and to learn financial matters that is waaaay beyond my level of comprehension.

Looks like I could use more help and role models.
