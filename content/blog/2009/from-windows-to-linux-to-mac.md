I can't really remember since when I have been drolling for a Mac: probably it's as soon as I saw the very first iMac in fruity colours. And now, a decade later, I finally get to own my very first Macintosh: the humble Mac Mini.

And for the whole week, I have been staying up until three in the morning getting to know this new baby of mine: awed by the simplicity and beauty of the thing and OSX as well as banging on my head over its little differences and quirks. (I still can't get over the fact that I couldn't Shift-Delete files)

Having gone through and used all three major operating systems, namely Windows, Linux and OSX, I'm pretty surprised how similar all these systems works and certainly couldn't understand how people would really swear over one system over the other.

Maybe it's just me being a computer power user which greatly reduces most basic learning curves and the fact that I'd google as soon as I face some problems that I couldn't solve. Or maybe I'm not really into games and gadgets in generally that I've to go through any head-banging to any solid surface when I find out that it doesn't work with whatever system I'm using.

Either way, I now got the perfect computer setup that I wanted, leaving only two things to wish for: a webcam that could take high-definition videos and Windows 7 Professional Edition, which I plan to dual-boot it with my Mac â€” mainly for my games and some occasional software development work.
