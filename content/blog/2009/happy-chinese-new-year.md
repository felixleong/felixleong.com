It's that time of the year again :), wishing everyone a happy Chinese New Year!

As usual, take this as a hiatus notice until February (though I have been blogging more sparsely these day). I do have my Eee PC with me so should my creative writing thinking cap was on, you can expect some great content and insights from me ;).

Till then, 恭喜发财!
