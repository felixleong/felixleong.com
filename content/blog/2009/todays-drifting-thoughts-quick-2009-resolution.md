As an exception, I'm not going to review my 2008 resolution as it turns out that I can pretty much sum up my progress in one line: most of them achieving to an acceptable (but not necessarily satisfying) standard. Would rather set out my rough plans for 2009 onwards and sort of plug in the holes and details as I go along.

I believe that the theme for 2009 would definitely be the fact of setting myself up: grooming and preparing myself to bigger things in life. The critical ingredients that I needed to develop now is surely confidence and how to establish powerful relationships with people - which, in another way of putting it, is to form my own "dream team".

With that goal in mind, critical thinking, creativity, devotion and courage proves to be more important than ever before in my life. Recognizing life is not the journey of the self but rather a dance among the whole existence may turn out to be very true, in fact. It'd no longer the chase towards an end but rather attempts to create greater influences that is capable to ripple across the confinements of my own limited social circle.

And in order to achieve that, there's absolutely no doubt that I need to come out of my own small box and needing myself to commit to expansion: in terms of skills and mindset. It's time for me to go up to the next level and learn and understand the more advanced and refined.

Therefore, the action plan would be to actively seek out for resources, either sourcing from the outside or to discover from within, and learn how to maximize their potential and influences, continue with my vow to do achievable things that could potentially bring great effect, and to learn how to measure the effectiveness or my actions and figure out means to constantly keep track and improve.

This is my resolve for the year.
