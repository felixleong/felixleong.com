### ~ #3 ~  
Running away  
On a lost path  
Without an end  
in sight

A unknown shadow  
Creeping;  
An instinct  
*"to escape from…?"*

### ~ #2 ~  
Remembering  
A distant past  
with a vision  
so bright

A weary soul  
Limping;  
Forgotten  
*"that I'm trying"*

### ~ #1 ~  
Approaching  
The ominous shadow  
with a terror  
unable to subside

A frozen pair of eyes  
staring;  
timidly asking  
*"What is it"*

### ~ #0 ~  
Engulfing,  
or so it seemed  
Yet left nothing  
in sight

A clueless soul  
Trembling;  
Forgetting  
*"…."*
