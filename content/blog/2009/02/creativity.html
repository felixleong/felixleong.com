Through a human nature of curiosity and a fulfilling need to express oneself, vision or just plain playfulness, we tend to find ourselves immersed in piecing the pieces together and make something out of it using our own hands.

However, being a world as it is: ours is a world filled with infinite possibilities, there's times that when our eyes were set on a farther horizon, all we could see is a sea full of these black boxes which we may not know what the outcome may be.

At times like this, sometimes one may feel helpless, overwhelmed and even lost; yet at a same time we may feel excited, engaged and optimistic on how each of our choices and focus would lead us into.

As we manifest something, we are not only creating - we are, ourselves, creating and manifesting our "selves".

I guess that's what creativity is.
