Come to think of it, it's kind of funny that we often tell ourselves to make sure that we live life and yet forgetting about that very advice? We often tell people that we don't want to live like zombies but yet reflecting back most of us are on the brink of becoming one (well, at least on the weekdays being unconsciously caged in a cubicle facing a radiation source for 8 hours).

What we usually tell people is that "we are earning a living" – sort of indirectly implying that it's about our own survival.  But the irony is that we are working at a living grave towards the grave.

If that's a scary analogy, well… I couldn't think of a better way of putting it.

And it doesn't necessarily have to be work, really. It could be about personal issues as well: going through the dull motions with people, or probably just lying on a comfy place, snacking away filling both our tummy and brains with junk that is conveniently available for us.

… and funny thing is, we never knew who's the mastermind behind what had became of us.

Clichéd, but scary indeed.{%- endmark %}
