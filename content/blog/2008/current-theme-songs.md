I think to find songs that would be the current theme song of my life, currently seemed like there were three :p

- (Pop/Rock?) Marionette / 浜崎あゆみ
- (Rock) talkin' to myself / 浜崎あゆみ
- (Pop) Keep tryin' / 宇多田ヒカル (sudden discovery after noted by [maryadavies](http://maryadavies.livejournal.com/), despite the fact I do had that album for a long time)
- (R&amp;B House) ESCAPE / MISIA

Usually those warrants me to post up lyrics and translations (copied from other sites, although :p), but I think that could be easily google'd (perhaps finding translation for ESCAPE might be a bit difficult), so I didn't bothered :p.
