Finally, some green on my table! :D

Just got this potted [mother-in-law's tongue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansevieria_trifasciata) from my parents after hearing about it's air purifying properties (apparently it's true based on Wikipedia stating a NASA study). Actually I got two of them, with one intended to be placed on my office desk. But considering that I'm switching jobs, I left it back home for my mom to cultivate another pot of it.

Am sort of thinking that it'd be nice (and pretty) to have a mini-aquarium by it's side. :)
