An unknown melancholy, perhaps?</p><p>What I know at the moment is that I find myself in many situations that I sat on a situation too long: what started out as a mild annoyance or dissatisfaction, tolerated and not act upon when needed, ballooned to a scale which I find myself overwhelmed by such emotional intensity that I couldn't handle.</p><p>At times of progressive transition to a different stage in life, it seemed to become more apparent to me that changes can sometimes does require courage: with some of them could potentially shake and replace your fundamentals, while others would leave you no option to remain or retain your old comforts. Some change does come with a price that you have to sacrifice and payoff.</p><p><em>"There's times that you just feel so painful in transition that you just want to run away from the present…"</em></p><p>Currently I'm working hard to hold myself together, seeing the past self crumbling down within me. It's another breakthrough that I must endure, only then I can realize…</p><p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">"Wavering<br />Doubting the journey ahead<br />Hesitating<br />Whether I should turn back<br />Lessons seemed never understood<br /><br />Would moving ahead<br />could enrich me with such enlightenment<br />of the deeper meaning of lessons learnt?<br />A never-ending journey<br />continued…"</p><p>(* Extracted from my current transition poem)</p>
