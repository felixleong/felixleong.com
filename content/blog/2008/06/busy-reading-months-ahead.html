<p>If there's a day when I stop reading, probably it's not a good sign. I'm currently stocking books like no end (talk about building my personal library :p) and I'm looking forward (and excited, if you can't tell :D) to complete my reading this year, I'm expecting myself to get even more enriched through my exposure of new things through books and real-life experience.</p><p>Anyway, here is the booklist:<ul><li>First Things First by Stephen R. Covey, A. Roger Merrill and Rebecca R. Merrill</li><li>Law of Attraction by Michael Losier</li><li>The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom</li><li>Secrets of the Millionaire Mind by T. Harv Eker</li><li>Jack: Straight from the Cut by Jack Welch with John A. Byrne</li><li>Monster Careers: How to Land the Job of Your Life by Jeff Taylor with Doug Hardy</li><li>Monster Careers: Networking by Jeff Taylor with Doug Hardy</li><li>Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom</li><li>Instant Manager: Time Management by Polly Bird</li><li>Instant Manager: Neuro Linguistic Programming by Mo Shapiro</li><li>Just One Thing: Twelve of the World's Best Investors Reveal the ONE Strategy You Can't Overlook by John Mauldin et al. (Chinese edition</li><li>鲁豫有约：智者，陈鲁豫著</li><li>鲁豫有约：男角，陈鲁豫著</li><li>不想当人，就别想当佛，吴九箴著</li><li>其实，佛不是佛，你也不是你，吴九箴著</li><li>图解10倍速影像阅读法，Photo Reading Official Instructors著</li><li>… and a bunch of Japanese books that I don't bother to list their titles :p</li></ul></p><p>Out of all books I have finished reading Law of Attraction in one day and I felt inspired and rejuvenated from reading it. Now I'm sort of rummaging between Monster Careers book and on Time Management as I believe those skills are the ones that I seriously need to pick up in the shortest amount of time possible.</p><p>Till then, looking forward to see more progress in my own development :).</p>
