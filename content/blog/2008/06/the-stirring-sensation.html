<p>Two job offers, a three-party bidding matchâ€¦ that's really an overwhelming experience that I don't know how to deal with, but I guess I know how it feels now :).</p><p>Anyway, I have tendered my resignation today and will be moving on to Panasonic R&D Centre Malaysia (PRDCM) in September, which will give me a whole new environment to learn new things. Am really grateful with E-Genting R&D (Systems) with all the opportunities available which really took me to the next level and uncovering and trained me in quite a lot of skills that really transform me as a person. Mainly after I took on the project lead role which exposes me to real users.</p><p>I guess after all this while going through the ups and down, I think I have outgrown my potential (in fact I believe I over-exploited whatever job opportunities that I can have my hands on LOL). So, despite being a hard decision to make, I think it's time for me to move on.</p><p>I'm not going into details about how the salary negotiation had gone through, but all I can say is that don't underestimate the temptation of more money ^^||. It's really hard to keep yourself calm and sane (i.e. know and set your priorities straight) when you have something that appears to be extremely attractive to humans. In the end, after a very long phone conversation (with Justin from the recruitment agency that I work with) and a gruesome soul searching, I finally came to a firm decision myself. Was probably not the best offer, but PRDCM gave me the best balance in renumeration and growth potential among the three.</p><p>Till then, let's see how things work out few months from now. Things could probably start to become more interesting to me :).</p>
