And what you don't see in the picture are that among these lying books, about two or three piles have two layers on that pile: i.e. one on the front, another behind the shelf. Should every book were to be placed in a standing position, I think I'd need <strike>another</strike> bigger shelf ^^||.</p><p>As part of my achievement, I finally have lots of shelf space now. Not planning to fill them up, but it's pleasing to the eyes :).</p><p>Now I had that done, now there's a couple of table space that I'd definitely like to see them being tidied up… :)</p>
