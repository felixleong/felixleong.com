As part of the revamp exercise, I have ported my manga tutorials over to this new site. For one thing I'm greatly grateful is the fact that the time I invested in clean HTML does really pay off at times like this. Hence porting stuff over was a breeze without worrying about HTML clutter.

Saying so, I still need to do some minor tweaks - hopefully completing them by today and continue with my other personal projects soon :).
