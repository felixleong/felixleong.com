Got my hair dyed for CNY again :), I bought a beige colour dye which I fully expect to turn to be like a slightly dark brownish colour later on and ends up pretty close to the colour of my current LJ avatarâ€¦ at least in the following photo:

Of course, photography is always at the mercy of lousy indoor lighting :p. Under sunlight it looked more like a brownish colour with beige undertones. But probably that just me.

I still had enough left for a second application, probably it'd turn out to be much lighter next time round :).
