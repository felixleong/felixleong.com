title: Books for January 2008

Hereâ€™s a list of books that I bought this month and have yet to read:

- The World is Flat, 3rd Edition by Thomas L. Friedman
- Think, by Michael R. LeGault
- Awaken the Giant Within, by Anthony Robbins
- Your Magic Power to be Rich!, by Napoleon Hill (which is actually a compilation of his books, namely Think and Grow Rich, The Magic Ladder to Success and The Master-Key to Riches)

Likely I won't be adding new books next month, but from my behavioural pattern, that's hard to say :p. (but I suppose my wallet will be the judge at that time ;p)
