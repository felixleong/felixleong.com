Damn artists decide to release their albums early 2008 >\_<||: MISIA with Eight Wonder and Lena Park with Come to Where I Am. And I had a bunch of holes in my collection (the "Gotta catch 'em all" syndrome, aka impulsive consumerism)! (Speaking of which, I just clicked away in [YesAsia](http://www.yesasia.com/) to fill some gaps)

Should I decide to spend on the others like Mylin, Sweetbox (Jade Villalon period), bond, SPEED, Miki Imai, M.O.V.E., Yuki Koyanagi and Aikawa Nanase I'd be broke by now >\_<|||.

Luck had it that I can always resort to online shopping and eBay. And time's by my side should I know how to control my impulsive shopping habit.

Dang it.
