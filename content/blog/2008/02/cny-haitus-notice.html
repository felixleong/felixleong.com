{% mark post -%}As usual, will be back to my hometown from 6 - 12 February, no Internet access from home = probably less/no updates :).

Depending on whether there's anything interesting going on, I may report my progress when I was back home to meet up with relatives, long lost friends and classmates. But highly likely that a drifting thoughts post or two will become a staple with an idle brain :p.

Anyway, to those who celebrate it, happy Chinese New Year! :){%- endmark %}
