{% mark post -%}there's times,  
when one is almost inconsolable  
engulfing heart throbs  
a strong pain from within

looking up at the stars  
with teary eyes  
alone on the street  
a sense of loneliness from within

reaching out of a mirage of you  
a close smiling face that  
could never be reached  
a painful yearning from within

calling out your name  
only echoes of my own helplessness  
rings back to me  
who's going to answer back to me?

oh, wishing star  
where could you be  
at this moment of complete despair?  
a darkness that cannot be dispelled  
by millions of stars far away

was becoming strong  
the only answer to continue on?  
yet i felt as if hope alone  
will never be a float  
keeping me from drowning

despite a pride  
that will never accept  
yet somehow  
pity seemed so relishing

why is it so?  
why is it so…?  
drowning myself with sympathies  
i fall back to sleep again…{%- endmark %}
