How shall one would feel getting such attention, as in being looked up to? Hmm… actually it's quite a blend of emotions actually. In a way, from the eyes of others, it seemed that you have reached a certain stage in life that they viewed as being successful. Behind the pride gained from such attention, yet it is also capable in exposing the empty shell within myself. Afterall, only I know what kind of challenges and problems that I'm facing currently and probably as well as some inferiority complex when I find myself comparing myself to others and my own goals.

Looking at myself in the past, when such attention gained, I always find myself trying to sabotage myself and do something stupid that makes me tumble down a little.

Come to think about it now, I suppose it's not something to be taken too seriously other probably a motivation in achieving greatest heights? As in don't care too much on other people's perceptions towards myself? I would see it as it'd be much, much more productive and putting the present into perspective and focus on whatever challenges and opportunities that were present. Somehow it dawned upon me that the importance of one's purpose in life and goals, either short or long-term, are extremely important for ourselves to move on.

Keeping that in perspective on where we want ourselves to be, and at the same time cherish the experiences that come our way… that'd be a good feeling in itself, don't you think? :)
