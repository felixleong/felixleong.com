Got my hair dyed for CNY again :), I bought a beige colour dye which I fully expect to turn to be like a slightly dark brownish colour later on and ends up pretty close to the colour of my current LJ avatarâ€¦ at least in the following photo:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/?action=view&amp;current=P01-02-08_1609.jpg"><img border="0" alt="myself" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/P01-02-08_1609.jpg" /></a><br /><br />Of course, photography is always at the mercy of lousy indoor lighting :p. Under sunlight it looked more like a brownish colour with beige undertones. But probably that just me.<br /><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/?action=view&amp;current=P01-02-08_1611.jpg" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/P01-02-08_1611.jpg" alt="Photobucket" /></a><br /><br />I still had enough left for a second application, probably it'd turn out to be much lighter next time round :).
