{% mark post -%}I think to find songs that would be the current theme song of my life, currently seemed like there were three :p<br /><ul><li>(Pop/Rock?) Marionette / 浜崎あゆみ</li><li>(Rock) talkin' to myself / 浜崎あゆみ</li><li>(Pop) Keep tryin' / 宇多田ヒカル (sudden discovery after noted by <a href="http://maryadavies.livejournal.com/profile"><img width="17" height="17" src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" style="border: 0pt none ; vertical-align: bottom; padding-right: 1px;" /></a><a href="http://maryadavies.livejournal.com/"><b>maryadavies</b></a>, despite the fact I do had that album for a long time)</li><li>(R&amp;B House) ESCAPE / MISIA</li></ul>Usually those warrants me to post up lyrics and translations (copied from other sites, although :p), but I think that could be easily google'd (perhaps finding translation for ESCAPE might be a bit difficult), so I didn't bothered :p.{%- endmark %}
