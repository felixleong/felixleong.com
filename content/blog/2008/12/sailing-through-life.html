Amidst the gloominess of the surroundings filled with fear and worry as the recession looms in, it had been quite calm in the company that I'm working at. Which I'm particularly glad of as I'm able to focus my energies into the pursuits that I'm engaging in.</p><p>Two or three weeks ago my life is more on the bumpy side as I find myself in situations that I trip and stumble. Just one of those times when things aren't smooth going, but along the way I learnt new lessons, understood my own surroundings and realities better, shifted personal perception and pacing as well as move along with life. If life is like sea faring, I suppose it's quite a good analogy that I went past a rough patch and was realigning myself towards the planned course.</p><p>Reviewing the week, the project that I'm in was just kickstarted this week and in a way "real work" has started. In a way, I consider myself very fortunate to have great teammates, which it's really pleasant to work together. So in a way, we are indeed on a good start :).</p><p>On the personal front, I have been spending time to read Stephen R. Covey et al's First Things First, which I'm just barely halfway through. But even without completing the book, I strongly recommend the book. Personally I'd consider Stephen's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as the framework and this book to be a very concrete action plan in initiating change in oneself by ensuring one has their "first things" first: the important things that aren't urgent but yet you're sure that it's will bring enormous and lasting positive change in the long term.</p><p>Will share more thoughts after I finished with the book :).</p><p>Till then, my life will still continue to surround with the theme of learning and manifesting positive creation and changes. I think I'll subscribe to the thought that "there's always new things to learn and do everyday" :).</p>{%- endmark %}
