The one here will be the new look for <a href="http://www.felixleong.com/">felixleong.com</a>, which I renamed it to be "A Day in Life" from the previous "Felix Leong: Pedagogies". The renaming was part of my attempt to change my focus and probably transform it as a more personal homepage from the manga drawing tutorial page.</p><p>During the design I was a bit unsure whether I wanted to mark a fullstop to this LiveJournal and having my entries over to my personal website instead… considering that now I keep track with blog updates using RSS feeds lately and I rarely had any LJ friends-only posts that I really keep up to often. Either way, should I be moving my main blog over to felixleong.com, I'll make a notification for sure. (I think, personally, I have that feeling that my own next chapter is drawing near and the shift back to my personal homepage may well be a symbolic move in some sense… but really it's really hard for me stick my finger into why I had that feeling)</p><p>But I suppose if I move my blog over to felixleong.com, the greatest advantage would be the ability to get statistics of my blog's readership :p (now I sort of get estimates from my Photobucket account, ever since I change my blog format to include a picture in every post).</p><p>In other news, there's a very sudden change in my working assignment: am now working on something else now. It's a bit of a shame that I was pretty convinced that I got a great team combination… but just keep my faith that things happen for a reason that great things awaits me :).</p><p>By the way, I'll be doing my customary 2008 review, which turns out to be one of my biggest life-changing years towards the better, if not the best. The post was sparse this year due to a shift of format and mindset, but I sort of skimmed through the posts and I still find the essence of thoughts were retained well without the noise of emo posts. So I think it's a good thing. :) Would probably be able to synthesize some new thoughts out from the stuff I written this year :D.</p><p>Till then :).</p>{%- endmark %}
