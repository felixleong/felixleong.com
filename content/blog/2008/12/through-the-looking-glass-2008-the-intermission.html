{% mark post -%}<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">"I think this has been one of the most common themes that I have put it in my LJ, things when I come to analyze what is the truth. Many times when things were either thought logically or perhaps put into perspective, some things that we take for granted that it is is actually isn't, yet once you understood a little bit more about it, it is again; then there's times you found new evidence that raises doubt, you doubt that it is anymore.</p> <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center;">Ah! The fickleness of the mind."</p> <p style="text-align: right;"><small>from <a href="http://felixleong.livejournal.com/398929.html">"Labels - It is, it isn't, yet it is"</a></small></p> <a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/?action=view&current=Photo-0214.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/Photo-0214.jpg" border="0" alt="Into the Light" style="width: 240px; float: right; padding: 0.5em;"></a><p>Whoa, what a year - It's sort of unbelievable that how dramatic 2008 has been to me: As it turns out to be the one of the biggest turning point yet. If I could only write this in the first paragraph (or if you rather just read the first paragraph), the main lessons I learnt this year:</p> <ol> <li>Shocking things happen when you least expect it</li> <li>Don't underestimate the power of repressed/restrained feelings, emotions and thoughts when unleashed: constructive or otherwise</li> <li>Everything happens for a reason: there's always a blessing in disguise when the event becomes hindsight</li> </ol> <p>Now, coming down the the details, 2008 really marks a positive direction on my part as I moved into a more assertive track (either consciously or by chance), which is a good thing. It's good when I decided to changed my focus and themes of my LJ in the beginning of the year by cutting down on the drifting thoughts that are getting repetitive and the emo posts. It's not particularly I don't have my lows points, but rather I choose not to write about them. Eventually it seemed that that act indirectly gave less attention to these peeves and their impact to me has greatly reduced in some way.</p> <p>But saying that, this chapter of my journey ain't over yet despite I felt that I'm moving on a transition to Chapter 7 back in June/July. Personally, not sure whether it is a self-fulfilling prophecy or not, the title "Reprise - The Journey Revisited" is indeed a fitting title to what I have been going through up until now. Why I'm saying that is because many of the emotions and events I experienced during the year have overlaps with the time when I started this blog: it's sort of a revisiting on some aspects of myself that I'm not that willing to face and gradually overcome and accept as it is. It is quite hard on me at times but the sense of liberation is something that continues to build and nuture me as a person.</p> <p>By all means, I'm still in the process of learning the lessons that came along the way and hopefully I'll be able to progress to the next stage in life.</p> <p>Granted, this year wouldn't be as intense as I would be without the strong influences that guided me: The tsunami of change, my personal job hunt and supportive friends and parents. Also I read very voraciously and found some strong inspiration from authors like Anthony Robbins, T. Harv Eker, Randy Pausch, Timothy Ferriss and many more. They really served as a strong inspiration in striving for personal greatness and am looking forward to learn more powerful lessons from life.</p> <p>So for the year 2009, it's definitely a year to really crack my brains apart and reexamine my thoughts, experiences and assumptions. I acknowledge it may not be easy and I can see the skeletons peeking out of my own mental closet (which is quite frightening, in fact), but I'll pull through. And all I wish for is guidance and some occasional nudges towards the growth direction ;).</p> <p>Also top on my list is to really strive to create more value to myself and others: Or in other words, contribution. I think this would be the stepping stone for me assess my strengths and developing the skills and knowledge necessary to design and build things of value and my own personal lifestyle.</p> <p>Till then, I'm really looking forward to 2009 and hope the momentum will continue to build up and blossoms. And as for now… think would be quite appropriate to draw out my plans… :)</p>{%- endmark %}
