> "A drizzle within, ripples through the surface of the soul"

That's what my MSN username reads today, even though I thought I have been through such emotional ripples, I can't seem to find a good word to describe. An unknown melancholy, perhaps?

What I know at the moment is that I find myself in many situations that I sat on a situation too long: what started out as a mild annoyance or dissatisfaction, tolerated and not act upon when needed, ballooned to a scale which I find myself overwhelmed by such emotional intensity that I couldn't handle.

At times of progressive transition to a different stage in life, it seemed to become more apparent to me that changes can sometimes does require courage: with some of them could potentially shake and replace your fundamentals, while others would leave you no option to remain or retain your old comforts. Some change does come with a price that you have to sacrifice and payoff.

> "There's times that you just feel so painful in transition that you just want to run away from the present…"

Currently I'm working hard to hold myself together, seeing the past self crumbling down within me. It's another breakthrough that I must endure, only then I can realize…

> "Wavering
>  Doubting the journey ahead
>  Hesitating
>  Whether I should turn back
>  Lessons seemed never understood
>
>  Would moving ahead
>  could enrich me with such enlightenment
>  of the deeper meaning of lessons learnt?
>  A never-ending journey
>  continued…"
