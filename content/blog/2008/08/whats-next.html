At that time I was still considering to stay put and commute to Cyberjaya, which will take me about two hours per trip. By all means whomever concerned was indeed concern about the duration of the journey, by all means four hours of commute per day was indeed excessive.</p><p>And now with thisâ€¦ I think I was left with no choice ^^||||.</p><p>With such a sudden notice, I really have to get moving and start doing something about it. Just hope for the best with everything.</p>{%- endmark %}
