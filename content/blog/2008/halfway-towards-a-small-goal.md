I'm pretty excited today because I found that I'm halfway towards reaching one of my smaller financial goals: attaining RM100K in assets :).

Judging from this year's economic outlook, it may be a bit challenging to meet the goal I have set for this year (RM80K), but it's my responsibility to work things out for the better :).

Till then, I might as well just keep my spreadsheet updated from time to time, but I reckon that I'd ignore updating the latest stock prices there until we see a stabilizing situation.
