(At least I don't find the picture personal to myself since what's legible is probably the big numbers and probably with good eyes you can read the name of two charity bodies that I supported, the name of the gym that I joined and some broad categories that I listed there. None of them personal unless one wants to know which gym to stalk me LOLOL)</p><p>Despite the notion of having a budget, I'm pretty lenient with the surplus of my monthly salary and by all means I live pretty comfortably and took pride of a decent and fun lifestyle. So personally I find comfort by the fact that I foresee all my expenses ahead of time and and being able to make quick decisions on "fun spending" without consulting my bank balance without worries.</p><p>And the only thing that would really keep my brains whacking out plans is when there's a big ticket item that I wanted.</p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/?action=view&current=ipodtouch.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/ipodtouch.png" border="0" alt="Item of Desire :p - iPod Touch" style="float: right; width: 240px; padding: 0.5em;"></a><p>So introducing the item of my desire of the year: The iPod Touch (not iPhone, despite the similarities :p). Now, this has just gave me quite a long time deciding whether I should get by <em>next month</em> (just say that I planned ahead :) ). The question now is not whether I can afford the RM1999 price tag for the 32GB model, but the case of debate is actually the fact that <strong>I could afford it</strong> but whether is it reasonable to get it <strong>now/soon</strong>.</p><p>And boy that's a dilemma.</p><p>Basically the main reason that rocks the decision boat is the recent economic slump that Malaysia's experiencing, all thanks to the drama that surrounds us (p/s: It's pretty funny to see how our political scene have made our mainstream news media becoming tabloids unknowingly :p). By economic slump I didn't mean that I'm looking into ways to pinch my pennies, but rather there's wasn't a better time to study the opportunities that surrounds us. With our local stock market slumping close to 30% from the year's high, there's a fair number of solid blue chips and great growth companies are close to hitting their year lows.</p><p>So… I am seriously looking into delaying the purchase, since my trusty third generation, 15GB iPod is still working well. And I could feel excited with a pair of hi-fi grade headphones for a change, which will only cost me a fraction of the cost of buying a new iPod Touch anyway.</p><p>But I'm definitely looking forward for a further price reduction or a good promotion (read: freebies) by year end, which I'm pretty sure that I could save money towards it. :) (or at least knowing the fact that the installment plan of my gym membership ends January next year :D)</p>{%- endmark %}
