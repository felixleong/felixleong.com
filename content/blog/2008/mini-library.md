I have been procrastinating long enough to organize my bookshelf: it's until stacks of books scattered around the floor and blocking my way to my own closet that I decided that I had enough.

Two nights of continuous effort I finally had my books in order and in place… where it should belong.It's sort of ~~scary~~ exciting to see the amount of books that I had the shelf that I have to resolve to dedicate two shelf space to put quite a number of books that I don't think I'd be referring to them soon on a "sleeping" position. And what you don't see in the picture are that among these lying books, about two or three piles have two layers on that pile: i.e. one on the front, another behind the shelf. Should every book were to be placed in a standing position, I think I'd need ~~another~~ bigger shelf ^^||.

As part of my achievement, I finally have lots of shelf space now. Not planning to fill them up, but it's pleasing to the eyes :).

Now I had that done, now there's a couple of table space that I'd definitely like to see them being tidied up… :)
