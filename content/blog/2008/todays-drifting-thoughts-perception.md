Just wanted to share to you a very inspiring book that has recently left me with a strong impact: Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom. Pretty much right on the nail when I needed the change of perception.

Just to give you an idea about the book, this book is about the interaction between the author Mitch Albom and his close professor Morrie, who suffers from [amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis) and was slowly dying as his neurological system slowly disintegrates.

The story narrates the last fourteen weeks of Morrie's life, which Mitch had his last fourteen "classes" on Tuesdays which is part of a "thesis" done between the two. Through those Tuesdays, they talk about every strand of life which is concerns us as humans, among them: regret, emotions, love, money, agingâ€¦ and of course, death itself. And each week, Professor Morrie transpire us with wisdoms of life as his bodily function starts to shut down one by one, until the day which ALS strikes the lungs and claim his life.

With simple yet powerful thoughts and questions laced in their conversation, the main message is what is it really mean to be alive and compassion is the key to unlock the ultimate richness that life has in store for us. "Love each other or die", that's Morrie's favourite mantra.

Anyway, I wouldn't want to spoil anything about the book, but the fact that it really brought me down to tears. Not because of the fact that the professor is dying, but rather it felt as if his words were alive and penetrates the deepest core of my heart and soul. It really gave me the feeling that Morrie was my own professor who really cared.

By any chance, I greatly recommend that you pick it up, even you don't feel like reading another book. When the time comes and as you find yourself pick up the book, I'm sure it'd give you a complete change in perception.

At least that's what had happened to me.
