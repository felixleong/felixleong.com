A year and a half has passed, the draft that was left dusting for a year…

Putting the missing pieces together and a whole new chapter was born, with hopes that one day I could finally assemble another big part of my own puzzles in life.

### Chapter 5: My Way Home  

*June 2006*

Throughout my journey, I have gained much, I have lost much as well.    
Threading the path, I have loved much, I have hated much as well.  
  
Through the time and tide, sometimes I felt lost, yet sometimes I was found    
Through the faces and places, sometimes I was blind, yet sometimes I can see  
  
The many things around me,    
The many secrets within me,    
In one way or the other    
Unlocked some of the doors,    
Unlocked some of the chains  
  
The many experiences I tasted,    
The many discoveries I found,    
In some way or the other    
Opened my eyes    
Unleashed my senses  
  
Vague as it seems    
The path I saw now    
Was the way "home"    
Whatever that is    
Which I had been ignorant enough to comprehend  
  
Many pains yet to be endured    
Many sadness yet to be encountered    
Many challenges yet to be faced    
Many things yet to be released…  
  
The journey ahead    
Was not as simple as it seems    
And yet    
It's the path that I chose  
  
Let my whole being tremble!    
Let my whole being be shattered!    
Let my doubts be cleared!  
  
Only then,    
I will know    
That I have reached    
To a place of no return…  
  
And that's only the beginning…  

### Chapter 6: Reprise - A Journey Revisited  

*January 2008*

From the beginning    
Ignorance    
The times I was yet unborn    
I had wished that I could    
see everything through  
  
Picking up fragments    
among the remnants of the past    
Then I started to understand    
the deeper aspects    
of whom I really am  
  
Only I understood now…    
That being able to seeing it through    
isn’t enough    
As all I could see    
a never-ending cycle ever repeated  
  
Wavering    
Doubting the journey ahead    
Hesitating    
Whether I should turn back    
Lessons seemed never understood  
  
Would moving ahead    
could enrich me with such enlightenment    
of the deeper meaning of lessons learnt?    
A never-ending journey    
continued…
