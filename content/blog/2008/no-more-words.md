!['Closing In' by Seh Hui](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/ClosingIn.png){: .img-responsive}

It's been close to a month now, lots had happened even though none was being mentioned: Coming back from Sabah, immersing into a completely new environment at Cyberjaya, shifted to a new office on the fifth day of work, attending my best friend's weddingâ€¦

Yet it seemed that I can't seem to find something to say. ^^||

Guess the intent of this post is just to say hi to those who are following this :p.

In other news, I sort of working on a few experiments in life, which includes adjusting my sleeping patterns (trying to sleep at 10:30 - 11:00pm nowadays) and reducing my Internet and computer usage. Probably will post thoughts about this one day.
