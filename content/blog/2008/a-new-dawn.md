After coming back from Sabah two days ago, I moved into Cyberjaya the next day (Plug: thanks for Theen Gee for the help :). Eight hours from now I'll be reporting into my new office, so it's sort of like a D-day for me, after all the anxiety, excitement and overwhelming emotions: A completely new environment, complete different set of people to interact with and a completely different ballgame to be in.

The days being in E-Genting R&D seemed so near yet so far away after a complete nine-days absence from all the hustle and bustle there. Not particular sure whether is it due to the distance, all of a sudden everything that I used to know years ago seemed to foreign to me and same goes to what I'm feeling now. The whole thing seemed so surreal that the only thought left on my brain is to face whatever that will be dished out to me in days to come.

Now I pretty much sorted out everything in the room, probably could use with some improvement and space saving techniques, but at least everything is in a particular order that I know where to find my stuff when I need them. Till thenâ€¦ let me have my sleep and prepare to face a new dawn in my own life.
