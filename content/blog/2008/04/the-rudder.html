{% mark post -%}Been experiencing one of the greatest "tsunamis" at work as we are witnessing one leaving after another, each with their own personal reasons. Being shocked with the departure of Sze Hau, I'd say that this is even a greater of a shock. Domino effect, perhaps? But definitely taking quite a stressful toll on everyone of us.

<em>"In times of turbulence, it became even more critical to hold on to the rudder"</em>

At least that's my way of reminding myself to remain my focus and not being swept away by all the tides in our surroundings and my own emotions. With the high tension on me being way off schedule of my development work, I can't afford putting myself in a weaker position than where I'm being now.

And the good news is that I finished the task! :D What's left is for me to package everything and iron out all the wrinkles that remained. As for now, I'm starting to pick up other skills to develop myself further :).

On another note, I *finally* bought The Chronicles of Narnia. So that means that I'd start reading it in the near future. Was planning to get His Dark Materials as well, but that's another wish list item that will get fulfilled reasonably soon.

Till then, I'm better pick up the momentum in reading and absorbing new knowledge.{%- endmark %}
