!['Vacate Notice' by Seh Hui](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/Photo-0076.jpg){: .img-responsive}

For some reasons I just felt that these few month, the more major events for the year in my life have uncanny timings and coincidences.

As time starts ticking away and I'm counting down towards a complete change of environment, the major concern for the people around me was either my career decision or, should I stay firm with my decision to make the switch, where would I be staying. At that time I was still considering to stay put and commute to Cyberjaya, which will take me about two hours per trip. By all means whomever concerned was indeed concern about the duration of the journey, by all means four hours of commute per day was indeed excessive.

And now with thisâ€¦ I think I was left with no choice ^^||||.

With such a sudden notice, I really have to get moving and start doing something about it. Just hope for the best with everything.
