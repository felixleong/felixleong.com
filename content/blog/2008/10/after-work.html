Despite not having its own annoyances (found myself in a pretty shocking surprise on the second day of Eid/Hari Raya that virtually no eateries was open around the area that I stayed at. Only consolation that there's always 7-Eleven with its ready stock of overpriced cup noddles :p), I'm pretty satisfied being in such a seemingly desolated high-tech suburb.</p><p>These days have observed my brain going on an overdrive as I pored deeply into information sources both at home and work. Having just set up my ideal working environment, I'm pretty much putting a lot of effort studying code and jotting down notes about my own discoveries (which can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time - that's something that I accepted as part of my own life as a programmer). Then at home I put equally as much effort in getting Japanese vocabulary and grammar wired in my brain.</p><p>With so much information stuffed in my brain, I sometimes have that funny imagination of having thoughts occasionally spilling out from my head and making clinking sounds on the ground (sort of similar of a waiter carrying glasses which are all full).</p><p>To me I'm sort of like, it's DAMN time for me to learn how to organize thoughts and make notes more effectively this time round. (and I kept wondering why effective note-taking was not taught in our schools) Am actually planning to nail my Japanese down by year-end and making sure that I'm confident enough to write and engaging in simple conversation with it. This item has been going on and off for so many times that it has to be put an end to :p.</p><p>After all, I have way too much interest and pursuits that I'd like to dabble into :).</p>
