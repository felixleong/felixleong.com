That by itself is worth feeling happy about :).</p><p>So now I got it back which gave me a different feel from what I used to know it: the screen is now perfect (the reason I sent it for warranty is due to some LCD glitches), the keys on the keyboard felt a bit "loose", which gives a very "spring-like" tactile feedback - something I liked about (being a geek of some sorts, such keyboards felt better compared to soft keyboards).</p><p>I think the difference now is the role that this small baby would take from now on: instead of just being a tool which I used to record meeting minutes (well, that's the main purpose when I first get it. Heck, I paid for it using that money :p), I guess it'll become more of a portable think tank of sorts. By that I mean I'd find myself bringing it out more often and use it as a means to do some creative drafting: collecting ideas for future writing (mainly blog posts, I guess) and probably develop some code. Well, who knows, but I'm realy looking forward to engage in more creative pursuits during my free time outdoors.</p><p>Wellâ€¦ who knows, probably I'd be able to come up with something valuable out of this exercise :D.</p>
