Sometimes I find working was way to hectic than it's actually work… well, I wish I could say that, but apparently with my emotional roller-coaster is still in the process of braking, I find myself completely drenched out of energy for the whole week. Also partially because my sleep debt is slowly creeping up to affect me (it's probably not the first time I find myself realizing the commonly known fact that sleep deprivation is a major cause of stress). That time was one of my lowest performing times at which I can't pull myself together to get things done.

And having people nagging you on things that I should (or even must) be doing isn't making the situation any better. I was already trampled severely by my own conscience ^^||.

Sometimes it's really funny to find myself not being able to do *any* productive work at home. I'm not particularly sure whether is it due to my perception that home is a place for resting and work should not interfere that private space. As much as I believe that achieving clear separation of work and private life is ideal, it can be sometimes a dilemma in the sense that sometimes it does get in the way or even undermine one's opportunities. I do wish there's a barometer in measuring such risks and rewards on when should that rule be violated or even justify the validity of the rule itself.

And so I have work that I must do and I was like, "what should I do now?"

So there I was this afternoon, experimenting with the idea of working in an environment that I find enjoyable and conducive at the same time. And there I was, at O Cha Cha cafe (basically a Starbucks like cafe specializing in Matcha tea drinks) at The Gardens, sipping my cup of Mint Freezie (basically it's ice blended Matcha tea with mint, which I greatly recommend), slowly nibbling away my piece of cake and at the same time swiftly typing stuff on my EeePC.

And I have to say that work has never been that comfortable and enjoyable before! I already like the cafe for being a comfortable and peaceful place to work in (as compared to Coffee Bean and Starbucks in which the environment can get a bit noisy and distracting), and having a plug point and wifi gave me the impression that I have converted it to a remote office of mine. It felt like I have spent RM20 to rent a small office cubicle (without the walls :) ) for two hours, and have nice food and drinks served to me. What a great investment, so I thought :). I think that will be the perfect spot where I'll do all my money-earning work for a small price.

Far better than grudgingly working it over at home and ending up procrastinating over it in the end.

Or probably I should start to look at creating my perfect work space back at home? Would really be nice to have that private space when I had my own apartment, that'd be a really cool idea. … Although I do wonder who'll be the barista though :p.
