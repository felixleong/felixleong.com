This is crazy! My reading-list is getting longer and longer and having yet another [BookFest](http://bookfestmalaysia.com/) end of this month isn't helping ^^||. Anyway, here's a new list of books:

- Investing Your Savings - A collection of essays on investing by Yeoh Keat Seng
- Rich Dad's Prophecy by Robert T. Kiyosaki with Sharon L. Lechter
- His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman
