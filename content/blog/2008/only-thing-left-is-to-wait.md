Finally I settled with the three preferred destinations for the 8D/7N hotel stay prize that I won previously. Posted it out and now all I needed is to wait for their phone call to confirm where I'll be going.

As for work, I sort of have a few contingency plans worked out on my head and came up with a resolve on how I should interpret the situation that I'm having now. By all means, I have to change for the better myself and it's not really an option anymore. The solutions and plans that I have now may not be all that comfortable for others and myself, but considering the fact that it has not happened yet and things will unfold eventually, I still have time to fine tune and probably make some changes in plans.

As for now, I must make the best decisions, do whatever I could and work things along the way with strong optimism that whatever the situation, I'll make the best out of it. Wish me luck!
