I have encountered deja vu just yesterday: I was seeing a reflection of myself - the exact kind of brashness I would have made was made towards me. With such realization, that impression really stroke me hard.

It's a strong unintended reminder to examine myself again.

So in a way I got a hard lesson (at least internally) today, that there are times that I have to swallow my pride and admit my own mistakes. At the same time I need to evaluate and understand my current position and influences, and keeping my antenna up on knowing what kind of role I should be playing. Even with good intentions, establishing my influence over others can't be forced and I must be figure out non-intrusive ways to reach out to people.

And constantly be aware and be genuine towards myself and others.

Till then, I still have a long way to go in the journey of self realization. :)

*(P/S: About the photo, it's a fortune paper that I got from a Chinese temple during my Sabah trip two months ago, which it's contents were written (and translate) at the beginning of this post. It has been in my wallet since that day and part of the realization I have written from this post is due to my unexpected discovery of this piece of paper.)*
