Just finished reading The World is Flat… and within one sitting I finished [Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture](http://download.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/), which came to me as a very enchanting read.

Skipping the review (probably would be integrated in my drifting thoughts posts anyway), they are bestsellers for a reason and I can testify to that. For those who haven't read them, I greatly recommend that you pick it up :).
