Currently I introduced enough wild cards in my own life which I felt makes my own future unpredictable… at least in the short term. When one has to have long term focus, sometimes such initiatives and decisions are inevitable.

*"… when you decide to move forward, there's no room for regret"*

To be honest, the situation is still misty as the storms has yet to calm its rages, ensuring the ship stays afloat is the still the main priority and I'd foresee it to be important to assess my own situation before making a decision on what's the next step that I should take. By all means all that I could do now is to work things out along the way and I need to make sure that I yield enough flexibility to meet up more challenges and dilemmas (if any; by all means I hope there aren't any, as in an ideal world ;)) ahead of me.

… Well, as I like to say to others these days, "It's going to be interesting year indeed."
