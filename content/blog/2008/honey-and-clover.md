Finally got round to watch the anime :), at least the first season of it. Kind of funny that when the familiar style of artwork was shown, it's just so J.C. Staff :p, but probably it seemed that I find myself watching quite a number of anime produced by them :).

Personally I like how they did the artwork and retained all the essence of the manga itself (except for most of the material of book 1 which seemed to be quite… erm… pointless. Even all the running gags are handled in a manner that makes it even funnier to watch it in action.

But, despite the fact that I find the pacing to be just right, I still find it too fast to cause a tear jerking impact to me ^^||. Probably also because it was so dialogue intense that it's quite impossible to relieve the deep emotional meaning without breaking the pace (read: pausing the video abruptly). I think in a motion format, I think that can't be helped and the static format of the manga shines in that aspect as I had the leisure to stop on a page for a longer period of time to relish all the emotions that gushes out from the pages while relating with the characters.

But for one thing is that it's definitely worth my recommendation :), but for the best effect, it's best to be watched together with the manga :).
