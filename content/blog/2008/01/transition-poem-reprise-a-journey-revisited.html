A year and a half has passed, the draft that was left dusting for a year…<br /><br />Putting the missing pieces together and a whole new chapter was born, with hopes that one day I could finally assemble another big part of my own puzzles in life.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Chapter 5: My Way Home</b></u><br /><i>June 2006</i><br /><br />Throughout my journey, I have gained much, I have lost much as well.<br />Threading the path, I have loved much, I have hated much as well.<br /><br />Through the time and tide, sometimes I felt lost, yet sometimes I was found<br />Through the faces and places, sometimes I was blind, yet sometimes I can see<br /><br />The many things around me,<br />The many secrets within me,<br />In one way or the other<br />Unlocked some of the doors,<br />Unlocked some of the chains<br /><br />The many experiences I tasted,<br />The many discoveries I found,<br />In some way or the other<br />Opened my eyes<br />Unleashed my senses<br /><br />Vague as it seems<br />The path I saw now<br />Was the way "home"<br />Whatever that is<br />Which I had been ignorant enough to comprehend<br /><br />Many pains yet to be endured<br />Many sadness yet to be encountered<br />Many challenges yet to be faced<br />Many things yet to be released…<br /><br />The journey ahead<br />Was not as simple as it seems<br />And yet<br />It's the path that I chose<br /><br />Let my whole being tremble!<br />Let my whole being be shattered!<br />Let my doubts be cleared!<br /><br />Only then,<br />I will know<br />That I have reached<br />To a place of no return…<br /><br />And that's only the beginning…<br /><hr /><br /><u><b>Chapter 6: Reprise - A Journey Revisited</b></u><br /><i>January 2008</i><br /><br />From the beginning<br />Ignorance<br />The times I was yet unborn<br />I had wished that I could<br />see everything through<br /><br />Picking up fragments<br />among the remnants of the past<br />Then I started to understand<br />the deeper aspects<br />of whom I really am<br /><br />Only I understood now…<br />That being able to seeing it through<br />isn’t enough<br />As all I could see<br />a never-ending cycle ever repeated<br /><br />Wavering<br />Doubting the journey ahead<br />Hesitating<br />Whether I should turn back<br />Lessons seemed never understood<br /><br />Would moving ahead<br />could enrich me with such enlightenment<br />of the deeper meaning of lessons learnt?<br />A never-ending journey<br />continued…</div>
