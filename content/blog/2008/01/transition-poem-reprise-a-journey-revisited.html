{% mark post -%}A year and a half has passed, the draft that was left dusting for a year…

Putting the missing pieces together and a whole new chapter was born, with hopes that one day I could finally assemble another big part of my own puzzles in life.

<div style="text-align: center;"><u><b>Chapter 5: My Way Home</b></u>  
<i>June 2006</i>

Throughout my journey, I have gained much, I have lost much as well.  
Threading the path, I have loved much, I have hated much as well.

Through the time and tide, sometimes I felt lost, yet sometimes I was found  
Through the faces and places, sometimes I was blind, yet sometimes I can see

The many things around me,  
The many secrets within me,  
In one way or the other  
Unlocked some of the doors,  
Unlocked some of the chains

The many experiences I tasted,  
The many discoveries I found,  
In some way or the other  
Opened my eyes  
Unleashed my senses

Vague as it seems  
The path I saw now  
Was the way "home"  
Whatever that is  
Which I had been ignorant enough to comprehend

Many pains yet to be endured  
Many sadness yet to be encountered  
Many challenges yet to be faced  
Many things yet to be released…

The journey ahead  
Was not as simple as it seems  
And yet  
It's the path that I chose

Let my whole being tremble!  
Let my whole being be shattered!  
Let my doubts be cleared!

Only then,  
I will know  
That I have reached  
To a place of no return…

And that's only the beginning…

<u><b>Chapter 6: Reprise - A Journey Revisited</b></u>  
<i>January 2008</i>

From the beginning  
Ignorance  
The times I was yet unborn  
I had wished that I could  
see everything through

Picking up fragments  
among the remnants of the past  
Then I started to understand  
the deeper aspects  
of whom I really am

Only I understood now…  
That being able to seeing it through  
isn’t enough  
As all I could see  
a never-ending cycle ever repeated

Wavering  
Doubting the journey ahead  
Hesitating  
Whether I should turn back  
Lessons seemed never understood

Would moving ahead  
could enrich me with such enlightenment  
of the deeper meaning of lessons learnt?  
A never-ending journey  
continued…</div>{%- endmark %}
