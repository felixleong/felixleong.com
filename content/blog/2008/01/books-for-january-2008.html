{% mark post -%}Hereâ€™s a list of books that I bought this month and have yet to read:<br /><ul><li>The World is Flat, 3rd Edition by Thomas L. Friedman</li><li>Think, by Michael R. LeGault</li><li>Awaken the Giant Within, by Anthony Robbins</li><li>Your Magic Power to be Rich!, by Napoleon Hill (which is actually a compilation of his books, namely Think and Grow Rich, The Magic Ladder to Success and The Master-Key to Riches)</li></ul>Likely I won't be adding new books next month, but from my behavioural pattern, that's hard to say :p. (but I suppose my wallet will be the judge at that time ;p){%- endmark %}
