… Sometimes I just feel stupid. Well… or in other words I’m starting to have some sort of difficulty of absorbing new knowledge and synthesize something useful out of the new found knowledge that I had. Or rather that I’m not able to see concrete results out of the actions that I have taken… probably a sense of insecurity?

But anyway, probably it’s because I didn’t do much homework in enforcing my understanding towards the new subjects ^^||. Just had that feeling of analysis paralysis all this while: trying to accumulate as much knowledge as I could on a subject but didn’t really translate them into action, so in effect feeling as if I’m shrinking and unsure of which world that I’m actually living in.

Or probably my sense of achievement is getting a bit numb and I’m getting harder to get excited over the achievements that I’m done all this while? Hmm… then I’d really have to rethink what is “exciting” to me then.
