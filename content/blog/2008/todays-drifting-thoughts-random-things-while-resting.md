Was offline for a few days as I was back in my hometown, only to realize that the Internet is starting to become more of a communication necessity to me… well… not really until you found out that you had one Internet auction you have to pay for within the week ^^||. But pretty much the thing about the Internet being a necessity or a luxury greatly depends on your reliance on it to do the stuff that you wanted to.

I mean, so long institutions provides a mean to do things in a convenient manner. The power of consumerism is that so long that institutions and corperations provide something that the customer needs and is comfortable with, there's no fear that there'll be no business for them.

It's like, stuff like cash deposit machines and online banking that was once unheard of in Malaysia were now becoming more of a necessity to those who are using it. At least I do find it very convenient to have everything done within minutes instead of hours (to drive to their offices, queuing up and stuff). It's like, it's not a life or dead manner if these conveniences were to cease to exist or not functioning, but I'd rather go through the hassle in finding one that provides such conveniences that would speed up some of the more routine stuff.

Hmm… which pretty much means that I would personally find myself hard to move out from a metropolitan KL (Kuala Lumpur) to a more suburban place? Hmm… but I suppose I might be able to adapt when the time comes (so long I find it beneficial for the change :LOL:) Probably it's all about priorities in life, I guess.

Other than that, I'm going to be with my parents until Saturday night, and at least now I had the only nagging thought settled (paying for my auction ^^||) and it won't bug me from time to time.

Most of the time spent at home is pretty much me reading and resting. Typical routine when I was back with them actually :p.

And on an unrelated note, … Kinokuniya stocks yaoi O\_O||. That's quite a surprise to me knowing how Malaysian were like when it comes to stuff like that :p. You wouldn't find surprising if you seeing me bu… umm, nevermind XDDDD.
