Either way, fear only gets real when you perceive to be so, (therefore) personally I would say that developing personal courage is one of the most important challenge to learn along the way in life. That's what I felt during my transition over to Cyberjaya.</p><p>Making changes in life often requires change in mindset as well, so I (also) personally believe it's a matter of whether you are willing to change your own mindset.</p><p>I think adapting to physical changes is something we tend to get overly worried about. (But) In reality, our survival instincts actually supports us in getting over such matters. And i believe that good people are always around… or at least god fearing people :p"</p></div><p>In case (might be none, though) anyone is wondering why this post all of a sudden, just say that something happened that I really needed that reminder to myself. ^^|| *sigh…*</p><p>Well, time to move on again then :).</p><p><em>(P/S: Oh! By the way, <a href="http://twitter.com/felixleong">I just got a twitter account</a>. Not that I'd anything interesting in particular to be followed, but I will very likely be posting impromptu thoughts and ideas that I'd want to blog about later on)</em></p>
