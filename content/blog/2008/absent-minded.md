!['Where's My Phone…?' by Seh Hui](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/livejournal/AbsentMinded.png){: .img-responsive}

For some reasons my brain cells seemed to dropping today ^^||.

I sort of find myself in a situation of noticing my phone was not in my pocket hours after I was outdoors… it's only until I dig into my pocket that I realized that. Then I was like… hmm… is it another theft/lost case or that I had become absent-minded today. ^^|| Then I sort of dig into my brain and vaguely (and not really sure, actually) remembered that I didn't bring my phone with me.

Sure enough that it was on my computer desk when I reached home.

Phew…
