… I was assaulted and had my mobile phone robbed, plus a knock on my left forehead with a helmet. Ouch.

Anyway, sparing the details (or rather I wouldn't want to delve too much about it), was robbed when I'm crossing the pedestrian bridge at Jalan Sultan yesterday afternoon. Decided to be admitted in the hospital for a day to have my head injuries observed and now recuperating back home. Lucky is the fact my damages, both physically and financially, is very minor, just a few bruises and a knock over my head. But I need to get a new phone, phone number and glasses; especially the glasses as my old ones was a bit overpowered. I wonder whether the occasional dizziness were because of the injury or my overpowered glasses ^^||.

But I'm extremely grateful that I have met helpful strangers and supportive relatives and friends. Now… I do wonder is there a way to develop a sense of intuition of sensing danger… :p
