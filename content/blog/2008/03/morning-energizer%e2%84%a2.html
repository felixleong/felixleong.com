{% mark post -%}Say hello to my new Morning Energizer™ :p <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/?action=view&amp;current=newalarm.jpg"><img border="0" alt="Photobucket" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/photo/newalarm.jpg" /></a><br /><br />It brought back a lot of memories as this is the kind of alarm clock that managed to wake me up when I just started school as a kid :). I can't think anything more effective than this to get me started, probably I should have bought this much earlier.<br /><br />Am planning to readjust my sleep patterns again actually, hope it'd be of great help :).<br /><br />By the way, got two new books myself while finding myself close to finishing Anthony Robbins Awaken the Giant Within, which strongly impacted me and reinforced a lot of concepts that I have been loosely building up throughout the years. It couldn't be a much appropriate time for me to dig deep and do some soul search at times like this, looking forward that such lessons will propel me forward towards my own ideals and goals in the future.<br /><br />Anyway, here's the new additions to my to-be-read list:<br /><ul><li>Unlimited Power by Anthony Robbins</li><li>A New Earth - Awakening to Your Life's Purpose by Eckhart Tolle</li></ul>{%- endmark %}
