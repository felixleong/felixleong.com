<p>This week I have myself drowned out by <a href="http://www.falcom.co.jp/ysf/">Ys: The Oath in Felghana</a>, I can sort of make out the meanings in Japanese sentences, so that's a good sign :D. Definitely have to study more kanji and grammar though :(, it'd be cheating to make smart guesses on the kanji's meaning based on my knowledge in Chinese. It's indeed a very addictive game indeed that instantly hooks me with fast-paced action with lush graphics. The game mechanics and system is pretty much tuned to perfection and the boss battles provide much variation that it's never a boring moment. Only gripe? Hard mode is bloody challenging &gt;_&lt;||. (I do agree with some pages that I came across that YsF normal mode is equivalent to Ys6 hard mode)</p><p>Well, I guess that'd keep me occupied for quite a long time :).</p><p>Oh yeah, I finally started to read The World is Flat, and I find it a great eye-opener and I think for those who haven't read it, especially those who are working, to pick it up. It'd make you rethink a lot of things and how globalization would affect and change your life in the future.</p>
