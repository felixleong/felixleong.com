Directly copied from my email I sent to my friends and family:

For those who aren't aware, Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture is the recent best-seller book in the market at the moment, which Randy, a computer science professor for Carnegie Melon University, shares his views and thoughts of life as he approaches death - literally, as he has only months to live due to pancreatic cancer.

For those who haven't read the book, fear not, you don't need to get it at all. I wanted to share with you his video of "The Last Lecture" which gain astounding popularity after this talk was posted on the web. You can access the videos via the video links in this page:

(Under the "The Last Lecture" section)

Personally I recommend to watch the video on Time Management presented in University of Virginia as well. Personally I find it very inspirational and his public speaking skills is worth learning :).

I strongly recommend, especially if you like the talks, to download the videos to your PC for repeated watching. You can use services like KeepVid.com to download the videos for free.

Hopefully you get as inspired as I do when watching them. :)
