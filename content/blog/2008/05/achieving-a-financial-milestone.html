<p>Today's the day! :D The first time I had the amount invested in two funds to hit five figures <strong>each</strong>. It took me three years to attain to that amount and it's really a great achievement in by itself.</p><p>Given that I will progress (read: salary increment), it's just the time for me to revise and up my investment amount as soon as that time comes. Now all I need to make sure I'm persistent in learning as I continue my investment journey.</p>
