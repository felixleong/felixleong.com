<p>What was previously a passive attempt had me more energized and becoming more active.</p><p>What I'm referring to now is job hunting. Wellâ€¦ pretty much it started with me exposing my resume and in due turns of events I ended up getting calls from headhunters. So now I find myself quite engaged in exploring possibilities outside while still working on whatever tasks on hand at the moment.</p><p>What's very interesting is the fact that the whole process is really an eye-opener to me, it's like the very first time I get to step into other people's offices and see how each of these environments were unique from the others and get to chat with a bigger pool of people. I get to find myself traveling into places that I haven't been before, such as our own Technology Park in Shah Alam and Malaysia's own IT hub called Cyberjaya. Just the fact that these areas are covered with lush greeneries was already refreshing after three years of being in the concrete jungle of Kuala Lumpur.</p><p>It's really considered my own first time to be in a job hunt, and my own virgin attempt in participating in an interview. But surprisingly I find myself more comfortable with people, compared to my previous self who gets anxious by the thoughts of talking to a stranger. I guess the people experience I gained when I was handling support activities in the previous projects does payoff, perhaps together with whatever I have learnt in the past two months through extensive reading.</p><p>Currently I'm looking forward to explore beyond and relish the experience that I gained from such exploration. Hopefully I'll land my next ideal job in no time :).</p>
