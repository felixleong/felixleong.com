Not in boredom, but having my thoughts drift away, pondering about life again. This time round it's about purpose in life.</p><p>From what I can recall from memory, this is one of the more critical questions that I find myself not actually putting much thought or probably has been neglected for quite some time. Come to think about it, I have been living without a clear sense of vision for as long as I remember: it has been mentioned a couple times here that &nbsp;I felt as if I'm a drifting log, deep asleep.</p><p>"I wonder…", I asked, "what have I done for the past 25 years in my life". Nothing particularly dear to hold on to, memories are all faded &nbsp;as if they were translucent in the backdrop of forgetfulness. Come to think about it, this has been reflected in my persona, and I'm unaware about it until now.</p><p>"… as if the soul is as vague as the wisps at night…"</p><p>When discussing about this topic, the word "rootedness" came to me all of a sudden. Can't particularly explain the concept… it felt something like a Zen concept to me. I think probably it's something like "Only the trees, deeply rooted to the ground, will have it's branches reaching towards the stars." Or probably in 7 Habits speak, you needed the solid base of character in order to actually attain your greatest potential and fulfillment.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes when I meet people that is capable a glimpse of such feeling, I sort of find myself telling myself "… I would love to be someone like that…"</p><p>"Sometimes… I wondered…", I asked again, "… what behind this melancholy, barely visible with its translucent guise yet at times effectively haunts, reminding me the darkness I felt in my deep slumber?"</p><p>"If there's a small light that I'm able to cast to dispell the darkness of my own awareness… what shall I do now…?"</p><p>What kind of meaning I could paint onto the canvas of life…?</p><p><span style="font-style: italic;">(to be continued…?)</span></p>
