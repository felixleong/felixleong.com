It's extremely easy to fall into the trap of being extremely self-critical. Especially when my confidence is completely battered down.

It's extremely easy to underestimate my own abilities. Especially being in a hyper-competitive world which everyone seems fixated into succeeding.

It's extremely easy to find myself feeling overwhelmed when I'm hypersensitive to how others perceived me. Especially if it involves the thought of fulfilling other people's expectations and not my own; if the “punishment” of not being able to achieve something is the potential shame that I have to endure.

Keeping the feeling unchecked, I find myself achieving nothing: so fearful that I shrink away from making any decisions or taking any actions that I know that I should be taking.
