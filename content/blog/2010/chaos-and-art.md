When we were children learning how to draw, well-intending adults feed us with unsolicited instructions such as “draw things like it really is, like a photograph”, “don't colour outside the lines”, “Winnie the Pooh is yellow, not blue”.

Unknowingly, these limitations imposed by people who didn't know art better starts to bind our creativity.

The thing about creativity is that to maximize its potential, you have to introduce some form of chaos – elements that break pre-made molds and templates and are completely unexpected, unconventional, counters tradition. Sometimes you just have to colour Winnie the Pooh blue to convey certain scenes such as night-time or that you intended the use of blue to symbolize something.

For those who understood such chaos will be appreciate it as a form of art. For critics there's never less things for them criticize in the world anyway. And rest assured that people who wouldn't care about blue Winnie the Poohs aren't interested in it anyway.
