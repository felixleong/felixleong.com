If the feeling of missing someone is just pure sadness, then dealing with and getting out of it would be very easy. It's just like any other sadness: just find the source and decide what's the best course of action to deal with it.

But as we know it, the feeling of missing someone is far deeper and multi-dimensional: depending on our experiences with the personal and our level of attachment with him/her, the feeling itself takes on other tinge of flavours – sweetness, joy, happiness, bitterness, fear, admiration…

It sometimes feels like a roller coaster ride: at times I feel like I was in cloud nine as I recall the sweetness of our encounters, and within one split second a deep sorrow sinks in and your physical absence further fuels my hunger to need you by my side at that moment in time.

Maybe it's just an obsession of mine… that I really wanted you by my side.

> Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it. – Thomas Fuller
