Complaining, one of our greatest vices.

Not only it's easy to do, it's also extremely enjoyable. Even better, you can weave any sort of excuse to your satisfaction.

The only problem with is such habits is that you may develop [learned helplessness][helpless]: by abstaining from personal responsibility, you may develop a worldview all problems occurs to you and you have no control over your life. Also if you happen to believe in [the law of attraction][attraction], what do you think you'll attract more of in your life?

Yes, there'll be a lot of things that proves to be impossible or extremely resistant towards change: like what had happened to you and its consequences, or hard-headed person you constantly brings you nothing but grief. But that doesn't equate to you unable to change your personal reality at all and get out of the situation.

So instead of delving into such nasty habits, why not learning how to [ask yourself better questions and take positive action][qbq] towards resolving the grievance you'd in life?
