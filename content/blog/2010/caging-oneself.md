Bolting up  
It's easy to lock myself in  
Shielded away from the outside world

Feeling secure  
Despite knowing it's only my illusion  
In a world that doesn't seem to care

It's perfectly fine  
Staying inside, wallowing in a sea of gray  
For a while — for a cloud to slowly pass by

Remembering  
The existence of the bolting lock  
And a world that's colored by myself

Time to get out… Unlock
