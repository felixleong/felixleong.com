This art is inspired by a gushing sense of loneliness as I was waiting for a bus on an empty bench. Emotions is like a weird, oblivious friend at times that invite themselves into the house whether you wanted them or not.

Looking blankly at the empty seat beside me, I'm starting to imagine: what if there's an imaginary friend sitting next to me? How would he look like? What conversations would we strike up before we have to part ways as we go into different ways? As loneliness induced state-of-mind abhors a void, my mind conjures an imaginary scene to augment an undesirable reality.

As I was contemplating the scenario imaginary exercise, a zen-like feeling struck me and I ended up with this illustration with a grammatically weird quote.{%- endmark %}
