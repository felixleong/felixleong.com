Nothing beats hard numbers to measure progress objectively, isn't it?

I find this thought empowering as it highlights the importance of managing my money and my future progress well. It is also a good guide post on how fast am I progressing and tells me the gaps towards my ideal lifestyle.

The word “score” also had the hidden idea that money is just one aspect of the game of life. Every game has our team, our supporters, our opponents as well as the experiences that we create together. It's not only the competitive spirit but also the aspect of the greater values we treasure in life: teamwork, respect, practice and fun.

With that in mind, that gives me the push to enjoy today and do whatever it takes to grow.
