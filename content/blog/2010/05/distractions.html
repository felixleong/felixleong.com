Mine came in the form of a Facebook game, <a title="Bejeweled Blitz" href="http://www.facebook.com/bejeweledblitz">Bejeweled Biltz</a>. Knowing <a title="Popcap Games" href="http://popcap.com/">Popcap</a> had a long string of addictive casual games, I should have known better. It does not necessarily come in the form of a game (for most I suppose it's <a title="Farmville" href="http://farmville.com/">managing a farm</a>); it could easily be any activity that contribute extremely little or no value but to show some form of “busy-ness”.

Usually it's a bad sign when such distractions happened too often.
