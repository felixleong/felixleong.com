I'm always under the impression that as each of us are unique individuals with varying experiences in life, we often have our own views, biases, understanding and assumptions when it comes to the world around us. And depending on our eloquence in expressing ourselves, we also have varying degrees of success when it comes to communicating with people. Especially when having two individuals from extremely divergent “worlds”, the demands of communications skills are far greater than one may be used to as compared to hanging around with really close friends.

It has been quite a long while ever since I had the habit of musing: letting my thoughts drift and experiment with philosophical ideas within the confines of my own worldview. And occasionally I end up gaining certain radical hypotheses in my worldview that I find myself particularly nervous to air such views when someone says something that I don't quite agree upon at least on an intellectual level.

Maybe it's just our own culture to avoid any sort of confrontation or conflicts as much as we could. Or maybe I'm just too self-conscious and not wanting to be perceived as argumentative, or even worse, a lunatic. But deep down, I really like some sort of a tribe of which we could engage in discussions and thought explorations without or minimal inhibitions.

It does made me wonder whether is just me feeling that way.
