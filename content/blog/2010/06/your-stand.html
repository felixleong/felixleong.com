It's just human being opinionated, but it takes guts to take a stand. More so if you carried opinions that is perceived radical enough to attract haters.

This card art is inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture</a>: in one part of the speech of retelling his story on setting up a pioneering and highly successful course at Carnegie Melon University, he puts on a vest with arrows sticking out at the back and shared the following lesson:
<blockquote>If you’re going to do anything that pioneering you will get those arrows in the back, and you just have to put up with it.</blockquote>

What's behind the fear that holds you back even though you are certain that your opinions are correct and you know what actions would change the world in some way or form?
