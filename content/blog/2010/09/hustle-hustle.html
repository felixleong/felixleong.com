Am in a hustling mode these days, spending hours till late to work on two personal projects of mine: <a title="Track Public Mutual unit trust funds prices" href="http://mutualtracker.com/">Mutual Tracker</a> as well as <a title="Hold presenters accountable during meetings: No BORING moments" href="http://fixmeeting.wikidot.com/">Fix My Meeting</a>.

Honestly been hitting several motivational brick walls with Fix My Meeting. The act of creating is hard: it's often a constant battle with my own flaws such as procrastination, fatigue, occasional disinterest, frustration, self-doubt and fear. Seth Godin term such this phase as “<a title="Seth Godin on The Dip" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/">The Dip</a>”: the time when the initial enthusiasm peters off and the frustrations starts to kick in.

It's good that I had several unimplemented features for Mutual Tracker which I had in the back-burner for months. Though admittedly the reason I had features for it being left at the back-burner is the fact that I couldn't get over the dip during that time.

Therefore it's important for me to hustle: it's the only mean to developing myself, continuously working on my skills and willpower to pull it off. As an experiment of public accountability, I will be posting progress from time to time, occasionally post the lessons I had learned along the way. For the time being I would be making these public accountability posts every other Saturday and work out the kinks along the way.

And speaking about Saturday, I'll be attending <a href="http://geekcamp.pbworks.com/">GeekCamp, Singapore</a> this Saturday and really hope to get to know some new friends there. And I pray very hard to avoid the <a href="http://felixleong.com/2010/08/the-ipad-shopping-marathon-and-geekcamp/">iPad shopping marathon</a>.
