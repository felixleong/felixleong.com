Have been going through a rough patch for the past two weeks, and it's comforting to see the first milestone among many that guides me towards the destination.

For two weekends I have worked on a new feature for <a href="http://mutualtracker.com/">Mutual Tracker</a> after a year since it's inception. It was a rough ride considering how much stuff that I had to learn about PDF parsing and scraping data off ASP.NET pages.

I still have yet to tie everything together and delivering them live. Hopefully I could achieve it by next week. Take it as a publicly announced deadline that I had set for myself.

Speaking of development, I have tons of fun with my iPad and even more recently the Kindle 3. Having too much fun, perhaps. By physically interacting with the device and some great apps, my thoughts and ideas on how am I supposed to approach <a href="http://fixmeeting.wikidot.com/">Fix My Meeting</a> is changing constantly. So I'm also looking forward to implementing them. I do have some doubts as I'm thinking of changing focus from making it a web app into a native app: I'm pretty wary of the thought of having to throw some great amount of work done.

Well, that'd be the end of my first personal accountability post for my project. If there's something that you think I should into more detail, do leave me a comment :).
