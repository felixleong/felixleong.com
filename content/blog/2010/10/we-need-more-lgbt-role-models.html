{% mark post -%}It was a really a pleasant surprise to me when President Obama had released a video for <a href="http://www.itgetsbetterproject.com/">It Gets Better</a>: a video project to gather encouraging messages to LGBT youths whom are often harassed, bullied and ostracized for being homosexual.

My thought after watching the video? We need more LGBT role models out there. Maybe it's just me that the scars may have carried over until adulthood and LGBT have to bear with the fears and psychological burden: living way below what they are truly capable of. We really need strong personalities and influencers which teens could really look up to: the world really needs more <a href="http://telepicturesblog.warnerbros.com/ellenshow/">Ellen DeGeneres</a> and <a href="http://www.adamofficial.com/">Adam Lambert</a>.

As I am thinking in the space I'm in now, I really wondered how many successful entrepreneurs and startup founders who had at least acknowledged their homosexuality public in one occasion or the other? I wondered what's the trial, tribulation and drama they have gone through? What mindset or actions that they take that conquers all odds that are stacked against them?

Somehow the thought passes through my mind like a dream… or maybe a project of sort, like a <a href="http://mixergy.com/">Mixergy</a> targeting a LGBT audience?{%- endmark %}
