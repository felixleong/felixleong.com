They call it the “creative block”: it seems to be a common disease among the creators.

Causes? Too many to list: mostly psychological.

It could be a battle of perception: either towards ourselves, our art or our imaginary responses we could get. The demons within, they say.

Or it could reflect our own nature: energy levels, enthusiasm and emotions. Things that we thought we are completely overwhelmed by and out of our control.

Most likely we are standing behind these excuses and blatantly denying the reality of our own weak-will.

If you insist that it's not due to weakness, maybe you aren't trying hard enough. Arguing against that would mean you are contradicting yourself.

Trying hard doesn't mean forcing art – it's about taking action to remedy the problem. Maybe we just need to take a break, soak ourselves in an inspirational environment, chatting with friends and peers to knock up ideas, practicing deliberately, find our mental blocks…

The thing is that you'd never know when the creative moment will come, but it'll never come if you never take action that stretches beyond our own boundaries.
