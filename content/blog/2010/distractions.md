Mine came in the form of a Facebook game, [Bejeweled Biltz][blitz]. Knowing [Popcap][popcap] had a long string of addictive casual games, I should have known better. It does not necessarily come in the form of a game (for most I suppose it's [managing a farm][farmville]); it could easily be any activity that contribute extremely little or no value but to show some form of “busy-ness”.

Usually it's a bad sign when such distractions happened too often.
