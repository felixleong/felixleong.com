!['Fixing The Basin' by Seh Hui]({filename}/images/2010/01/FixBasin-small.png){: .img-responsive}

Honestly speaking, I didn't get the masculine appeal of DIY (do-it-yourself).

But recently when the tap of my bathroom sink had a crack, my morning routine is always greeted by some unwanted fountain gushing through the cracks (without the laser show and synchronous music). I'm not sure how I had that twisted sense of logic being too lazy to call a plumber, I ended up deciding to fix it up myself.

After having a mild testosterone rush visiting the hardware store *(realization #1)* and getting the tools I needed, I got down to work. Immediately the absolute difficulty of accessing the nuts within a confined 13-centimeter space (which no normal spanner would be of any use in this situation) had garnered enough hate that I hereby declare the inventors and designers of the bathroom sink were bloody evil sadists with a porcelain fetish. *(realization #2)* But I digress.

Getting the first nut out is easy actually with a basin wrench. It's the top-most faucet nut which even the basin wrench couldn't access to that makes it a bitch. I'm pretty much left with my bare hands to get it out. I really cursed out loud as I desperately trying to pry a really tight nut, something my feeble strength couldn't really make it budge. *(realization #3)*

I really wished that I bought a hacksaw at the hardware store *(realization #4)*.

It ended up taking me a whole three hours to have the tap replaced. After the herculean effort I had made to replace it, I had the strong sense of accomplishment that I could do it… as well as feeling like a real man. *(realization #5)*

Hmmm, I wonder what other project would I want to take up next? :LOL:
