Call me dense, but I'm not good at telling apart jokes that sounded serious or could be a serious request.

The most annoying joking statement I had heard are ones that goes like “you're so rich/you earn more than I do, therefore you can <em>[do X]</em>”. Seriously. Unless he is a friend whom I knew well, I really couldn't tell whether is it just a friendly complaint about his financial situation, him being sarcastic or, even worse, a bitter snide well concealed as a joking remark.

Usually I'd just laugh along with it. But with all seriousness I kept a mental note of keeping a distance with these subtle complainers so that I could have a good look at their character.
