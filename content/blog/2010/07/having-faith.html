This is one of the earliest quotes that I'd conceived and has since become one of my key supports I lean upon.

This especially rings true when life's a mess and the future seemed bleak and shrouded in darkness. While it's easier to wallow in self-pity, this is exactly when one should police the thoughts that goes through our minds. No light can come in if you allow yourself to drown deeper into a negative spiral of despair.

It takes <strong>courage</strong> to accept our sorrows and the undesirable state we are in. It takes <strong>effort</strong> to pick ourselves up and take a correction course to improve or change our situation. It takes <strong>confidence</strong> to trust ourselves that we have the skills, resources and ability to pull it off and overcoming obstacles ahead of us. And most importantly it takes <strong>faith</strong> to believe that in the end, everything will turn out to be all right.

Hence the quote.
