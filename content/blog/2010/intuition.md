I couldn't put it more succinct than that.

This particularly applies to my current situation when I find myself restless and constantly seeking out for answers. Combined with my natural tendencies to hoard, I would overload myself with information on how to do something, believing that I need to know everything I possibly can before making the move.

And I forget that the main barrier is actually not taking the first step to make it happens. It's way more important to allow myself to stop and turn within, as there are answers that I couldn't possibly seek from the outside.

Honestly I haven't allow my intuition to flow through me. It's time for me to slow down and cultivate a space for myself to tune in and tap into that inner guidance, counsel my inner childÂ  and comforting my lizard brain.
