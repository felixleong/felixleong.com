I had just got myself a <a href="http://bamboo.wacom.com/">Wacom Bamboo</a> tablet and this is the first card-toon that I had done digitally.

This remind me of a <a title="Give Up, from Dave Navarro's Rock Your Day" href="http://www.rockyourday.com/give-up/">great article from Dave Navarro</a>, aptly titled <em>Give Up</em>, explains that the reason we met with persistent obstacles and frustrations is because we are unwilling to give up tolerating with them.

Stepping up to owning responsibility and claiming what we rightfully deserve could be a scary thing, hence we allow ourselves to be hindered by limiting beliefs. David really nailed it when he says:
<blockquote>Whatever seems ludicrous, whatever you say “I could never do that …” to, that’s the limiting belief that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are absolutely committed to</span>.  In fact, you’re so committed to it that you’ve got a ready-made collection of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reasons</span> excuses to support it – and you’ll fight me like hell before you give it up.</blockquote>
I have lived with my own limiting beliefs for about a decade: taking self-inflicted abuse way longer than I should. I'm now taking matters into my own hands now and I had a deadline set for it.

I will disclose my plans in a future post: for now it's suffice to say that I'm fully committed to <a title="Questioning Goals: My manifesto and commitment" href="http://felixleong.com/2010/05/questioning-goals/">live up to my manifesto</a>.
