I got my first Moleskine notebook, thanks to the 20% notebook sale <a title="Cziplee: One of the greatest stationery and art supply stores in Malaysia" href="http://cziplee.com/">Cziplee</a> is having. I'm a nerd when it comes to stationery :).

As I took the train home, just to kill time I start to doodle on the cover page. It started off with some random patterns on the top-right corner of the page. As I go on, it's almost as if I'm got into a trance: engrossing and engaging in this creative activity. I would then go on adding random basic shapes that don't resemble anything and the doodles organically spreads out until it filled up the page. By the time when I completed it, the train stops at exactly the station where I'm supposed to get off.

I recall a study mentioning that every doodle reflects a part of your unconscious mind. You can say it could be interpreted as an image that expresses the artist's internal state of being. I wonder if some psychoanalyst tries to interpret it, what would they say?

The only thing that kept on catching me eye is the sole pair of eyes that looks back at me curiously. That cute little creature is added on a whim and yet in a deliberate manner. And I'm curious how he's the only one that was there among a sea of abstract patterns?

Maybe I should draw more cute little creatures on the page next time. :){%- endmark %}
