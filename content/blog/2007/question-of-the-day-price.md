Fulfilling one’s desire often has a price. Something has to be paid or sacrificed in order to have a chance to obtain something else: effort, time, comfort, dreams…

Throughout the journey, how many things that I have desired for? How many things I have sacrificed? How many times I have regretted? How many times I forget that whatever I had was once something that I had paid the price for…?

Why there’s are things that seemingly unattainable? Why emotions can sway so violently that blinds us in one way or the other? Why in the world does pain exists?

Being connected and interdependent with my own surroundings, decisions and actions often create that energy that causes ripples that we call as side effects.

Stand where I am now, an outer journey that connects with the lives of the others, at the same time an inner journey that I have to thread alone… so distinct yet so intertwined.

“Am I really alone? Does anyone really need to know my own problem?”

Answers that seemed to be so obvious from the outer aspect seemed so hard to convey when comes to what I’m feeling deep down.
