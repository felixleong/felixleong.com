It’s time to review my goals again :)

<strong>(Optional) Work out on my personal website on something that I have great passion for</strong>
Just added three blogs, but to be very frank, they were very dormant.

<strong>Attain an asset of RM45,000 (I’m raising that bar again. RM20K seems pretty hard, to be honest. But since I’m studying more about common stocks, I think this should give me a good goal to achieve)</strong>
Surprisingly, due to the strong economy and an unexpected bonus that I received, I nailed the target yesterday (when my pay and year-end bonus was deposited). I’m not planning to splurge on them so I suppose that counts as I can sustain this amount as it is :).

<strong>Continue to learn my Japanese, working more extensively on my own vocabulary. (Optional) Take up an elementary Japanese proficiency test would be a plus</strong>
My Japanese is getting better, but it’s still a long way of understand most of the stuff I have read and watch. But seemingly I can work out what the anime characters are saying so that was a good encouragement. Didn’t took the test though, but I’m really planning to take the JLTP Level 3 test this year :).

<strong>Continue with my efforts to improve and understanding myself. This pretty much applies to… well… I think it’s more about self acceptance, really. Continue to pick up courage and grow from all the challenges and mistakes that I had in life.</strong>
In short, I have grown up quite a lot throughout the year: although there’s quite a lot of rough edges, but I came out working things out while the challenges were set. For one thing is that it’s still an on-going process of self-discovery and finding oneself in life. I think I’ll cover more ground of it while I type out my year in review posts.

<strong>Improve my financial knowledge and start to plan on my dreams and goals in life. This is going to be tough on me as I find my own dreams and goals have been shattered at one point last year… that’s something for myself to figure about</strong>
Been reading quite a lot these days, still didn’t find and set a very concrete goal for myself, to be really frank. That’s something that I still need to do along the way.

I think I’ll be keeping my goals for 2008 the same but with some slight modifications, I might add something later if something suddenly pops up on my head that time :)<ul><li>Attain an asset of RM80,000 (A higher bar again! :D And it’s getting close to the RM100K mark!
