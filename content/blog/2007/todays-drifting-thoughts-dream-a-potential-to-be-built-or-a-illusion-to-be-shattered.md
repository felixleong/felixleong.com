(11:27:26) Felix Leong: i think the thing is that you just have to get the best that you can grab and try to improve on the situation  
(11:27:37) Felix Leong: a perfect scenario can only happen with great luck  
(11:28:02) Felix Leong: can't expect everything falling right into the picture frame squarely, right?  
(11:28:25) Felix Leong: sometimes life is more like a messed up jigsaw puzzle than anything  
(11:28:52) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: and a long way to walk b4 reaching the destination  
(11:28:54) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: bleh  
(11:28:56) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: lol!  
(11:28:59) Felix Leong: yea  
(11:29:14) Felix Leong: sometimes i felt frustrated over that aspect of life  
11:30  
(11:30:06) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: lol and got trick again and again thinking u almost there but then u hv god knows how many miles to go  
(11:31:29) Felix Leong: the excitement of reaching somewhere always ended up being watered down by the journey that you have to go further in order to reach your goals  
(11:31:53) Felix Leong: i don't know, sometimes our aspirations and dreams can both be a motivator and dampener  
(11:32:12) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: yeah  
(11:32:25) Felix Leong: it all depends on how much you can really overlook the price and sacrifice that you have to pay  
(11:32:39) Felix Leong: or at least feel that it's worth it  
(11:33:08) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: mor elike giving almost all not to mention sleep  
(11:33:10) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: lol!  
(11:33:48) Felix Leong: the barrier is always there, i would say  
(11:34:02) Felix Leong: i takes a great internal resolution in order to achieve that  
(11:34:36) Felix Leong: a breakthrough of your current mindset and the limitations (internal and external) that was blocking you  
(11:34:51) Felix Leong: … and whether is it worth "dying" for  
11:35  
(11:35:04) Felix Leong: (not particularly "dying in terms of physical death)  
(11:35:14) Felix Leong: if you get my drift  
(11:35:44) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: oh lol! u mean if the job is worth dying for?  
(11:37:30) Felix Leong: as said, not particularly mean a physical death  
(11:38:02) Felix Leong: more like you are willing to sacrifice something you perceived as "important" to you at that current phase in life  
(11:38:23) Felix Leong: note that i said "*perceived* as "important" to you at that current phase in life"  
(11:38:43) Felix Leong: reason i said that is because we tend to cling onto things  
(11:39:19) Felix Leong: even though that's the very thing that kills us slowly but gives us small pleasures that we won't let it go  
11:40  
(11:41:31) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: hmm but then again it's what i been wanting to do since small…it's like dream job to me…it's like u will not stop until u are there working the job u want, and there is no job can compensate that  
(11:42:05) Felix Leong: but that's the thing: your impressions of a dream may not match the price that you have to pay in order to put the dream into reality  
(11:42:33) Felix Leong: so it comes down to how much sacrifice you'd put forth in order to achieve that  
(11:42:54) Felix Leong: and then the decision whether you want to go forth to realizing it  
(11:43:22) Felix Leong: we, as humans, can be weak  
(11:43:40) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: i c  
11:45  
(11:45:32) Felix Leong: when there's a gap between the effort you think you can do away with in your dream and the effort that is actually required (or was actually imposed to you when you attempt it)  
(11:46:07) Felix Leong: the impact of defeat is something that really tests the strength of your mind, body and soul  
(11:46:25) ♪.59: Love Labour's Lost: ic i c  
(11:48:24) Felix Leong: if one can't absorb the impact of defeat, that's already the end of that dream  
(11:48:41) Felix Leong: the thing is, you can't foresee the actual weight/value of your dreams  
(11:48:58) Felix Leong: it may be extremely valuable or completely useless  
(11:49:24) Felix Leong: therefore life's common dilemma: to be or not to be
