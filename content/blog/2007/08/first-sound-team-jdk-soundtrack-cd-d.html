Finally! The first time I owned a Falcom soundtrack CD! :D Falcom J.D.K.BAND 1 arrange CD.

Sound Team JDK had always been one of my favourite video game music composer ever since I was exposed to Falcom game’s like 英雄伝説3:白き魔女 (was ported to PSP as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Heroes_III:_Prophecy_of_the_Moonlight_Witch">The Legend of Heroes III: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch</a>) and Ys II.

Anyway, here’s a sample of one of my favourite VGM of all time:
