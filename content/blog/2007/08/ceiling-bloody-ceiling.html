{% mark post -%}Been having the feeling as if I have bumped onto a mental ceiling at the moment. Was it a sign I have reached my limits? Ugh… if that’s the case that wouldn’t be nice :(. I was like thinking “I’m just barely 25, and that’s all I got?!”, and I’m not particularly satisfied with what I’m in right now.

*sigh*…

(*note: Speaking of which, it's been a year since my last transition poem was written, so in a way it was currently the longest chapter in my own LJ. Well, it's still not the time yet for Chapter six yet… although from time to time I did collect bits and pieces for the next poem. But there aren't a strong theme that I would like to express [i.e. no major transitions happened yet] so I suppose when it happens, it happens. Well… at least that had been the case for most of my life transitions.){%- endmark %}
