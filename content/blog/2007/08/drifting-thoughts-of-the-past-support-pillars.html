This is an extract (or only partial) of my theories regarding view emotional support as pillars, which is basically in the form of an MSN conversation with Allen.

(01:57:03) Allen: and this morning after i read that message, i ws even thinking of running to my ex to seek comfort
(01:57:07) Allen: eeks
(01:57:09) Allen: lol!
(01:57:18) Felix Leong: i’d say it’s normal
(01:57:26) Allen: all the social connection are online
(01:57:31) Felix Leong: after all, at one point your ex was a very strong emotional support
(01:57:50) Felix Leong: compared to the likes of myself being a normal friend who shared heart to heart talks
(01:58:18) Felix Leong: that’s how emotional support pillars work
(01:58:45) Allen: now i finally know what emotional support pilars means :P
(01:59:33) Felix Leong: heh, that’s one of my fav theories/analogy that i like to use
(01:59:46) Felix Leong: at least for drifting thoughts 2007
(02:00:05) Allen: haha i wasn’t that clear of ur term
(02:00:31) Allen: now i finally know it’s a kinda emotional safety net
(02:00:32) Felix Leong: well, basically it’s a long theory on its own
(02:00:39) Felix Leong: yeah
(02:00:57) Felix Leong: but safety nets are more meant for emergencies, imho
(02:01:07) Allen: the thing the ease our pain and sooth the heartache
(02:01:15) Allen: oh?
(02:01:25) Allen: there’s another term for emergency?
(02:01:36) Felix Leong: pillars are more vital if you look your being as a structure
(02:02:32) Allen: *visualising*
(02:02:32) Felix Leong: i would say safety nets have to be your parents, or whomever you are most grounded with
(02:02:42) Allen: ahh i see
(02:03:07) Allen: well i dun have gay emotional support anyone from family yet
(02:03:31) Felix Leong: that’s why safety nets were as good as to keeping you afloat
(02:03:40) Felix Leong: but never good enough to support you through
(02:03:54) Felix Leong: well… at least from my current situation
(02:04:15) Felix Leong: that’s how it looked
(02:04:15) Allen: true…i guess same as me unless my parents are open minded
(02:05:20) Felix Leong: i prefer using the term pillars because that’s the part that supports your roof
(02:05:30) Allen: oic
(02:05:38) Allen: so see ourself as a roof
(02:05:52) Felix Leong: at least a person beneath the roof
(02:06:17) Felix Leong: the roof can be just sufficient enough to give you shelter or well built enough to give you comfort
(02:06:32) Felix Leong: that represented our physical surroundings
(02:06:41) Allen: i see
(02:06:56) Felix Leong: the pillar, is whatever that supports it
(02:07:10) Felix Leong: typically if there’s no pillars, the roof have to be balanced on your head
(02:07:40) Allen: yeah or fall on top of us
(02:07:43) Felix Leong: therefore things like fear, insecurity, emotional instability comes from
(02:08:06) Allen: i see
(02:08:30) Felix Leong: therefore pillars were important
(02:09:02) Allen: pillars is just for our lovers? or they are included our parents?
(02:09:06) Allen: n support peers?
(02:09:09) Felix Leong: they can be anything
(02:09:34) Felix Leong: but will definitely vary in strength
(02:10:14) Felix Leong: but if you have a lot of pillars, you are already in a state of comfort that you’ll prefer to sit under one pillar
(02:10:23) Felix Leong: hugging it occasionally
(02:10:31) Felix Leong: almost as effective as a teddy bear
(02:10:41) Felix Leong: usually that pillar would be your lover
(02:10:49) Allen: ahhh
(02:10:51) Allen: i see
(02:11:02) Felix Leong: but it can be something else depending on which stage of life you are in and what’s the most important
(02:12:05) Felix Leong: the perception of distance between our heads and the roof, as well as the very thought that the roof may fall on our heads, represents our mind
(02:12:13) Felix Leong: illusions, fears, desire…
(02:12:25) Allen: i see
(02:13:00) Felix Leong: but essentially, if you are able to look from a different angle, you are also a pillar on your own
(02:13:13) Felix Leong: which may as well support several roof at once
(02:13:27) Allen: isee
(02:13:40) Felix Leong: and, at least by this analogy and my current theory, is that once you see the interdependency and able to see past your own perception
(02:14:01) Felix Leong: you will be enlightened and hence you have become “fearless”
(02:14:24) Felix Leong: and therefore capable to go beyond the roof to the infinite
(02:14:49) Allen: the self pillar angle is still unclear for me hehe or umm 陌生
(02:15:08) Felix Leong: i.e. the roof may as well be an invisible barrier
(02:15:23) Felix Leong: it’s ok if you don’t understand the self pillar part
(02:15:33) Felix Leong: as i have always said, it’s just my theory
(02:15:54) Felix Leong: nothing proves it to be true
(02:16:01) Allen: haha ok ok…but ur theory has logics haha
(02:16:19) Allen: i’m just a personal who simply see a step and walk a step
(02:16:24) Allen: person*
(02:16:34) Felix Leong: coming back to pillars
(02:16:49) Felix Leong: as said, a pillar can be anybody
(02:16:59) Allen: yep
(02:17:00) Felix Leong: and once a pillar is estabilished, it’ll remain there
(02:17:11) Allen: parents , friends, support peers, god
(02:17:18) Allen: lover
(02:17:27) Allen: or anyone we seeks safe n comfort
(02:17:32) Allen: ok
(02:17:35) Felix Leong: and some pillars that you built yourself and was given a name
(02:17:44) Felix Leong: an association
(02:17:49) Allen: yep
(02:18:28) Felix Leong: so in a way, ex’s can have stronger influences
(02:18:58) Felix Leong: since your memory does jogs back and you can vaguely recall that there was once you were there
(02:19:22) Felix Leong: even tho the pillar has been an extremely deplorable state now or that it has been reduced to shambles
(02:19:38) Allen: yeah
(02:20:03) Allen: i see ex as pillars which has fallen to bits
(02:20:09) Allen: pebbles
(02:20:19) Felix Leong: ok then, enough of my theories now, i need to go to sleep
