I definitely had screwed up this month's expenses and budgets, I barely had any money left for my Cambodia trip next month -\_-||. Well… not that I didn't had my savings though, just knowing the fact that my indulgence for J-Pop for the month has pretty much effectively eating into my savings was not all of a nice thought ^^||.

But from the looks of it, it's just inevitable that I'd end up digging into my savings. Guess that's the payment of the lesson that I'm going to learn about budgeting: Great discipline necessary. But it's just a small dent and I can cover it up provided that I don't buy too much stuff for the next two months.

Other than that, I was on an "unexpected" day of rest today as my work today just involved getting the temperature of the terminals. And apparently I can't manage to get a remote-measuring thermometer and therefore I have to use the normal, chemical based one (I remember I purposely get those "no mercury used" type). So pretty much I was (unintentionally) slacking off as a result of needing myself to leave the thermometers in there. And waiting there without anything to do was boring indeed.

But anyway, tomorrow would see me picking up great paces in work when I *finally* had less distractions enough to do my real, crucial work, bug fixing. (although, honestly speaking, I would rather do something else. Or at least in work, just pure programming tasks that I can do on my own pace would be great. But in reality, there's always a deadline, which pretty much means no excuse in lagging behind, whatever the cause)

At the moment I'm still in the state of needing a breather. Seems that I need a few hours to watch anime and play games in order to relieve the "stress" that I'm having now. And that pretty much left me with no time to actually do/learn the things that I wanted. But probably I'm just over-indulging with entertainment… well… it's hard to be sure, to be honest. Balance is such a hard-to-grasp concept to me at the moment.

Anyway, I think I have a few more DesktopTD games before I hit the sack.
