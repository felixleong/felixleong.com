First of all, happy 2008! :D

Anyway, just completed my Chinese New Year shopping this year. After being fed up with the amount of T-shirts that I had, I opt for collared ones. Just cutting all the crap of me failing my shopping trips, this trip to Sungai Wang Plaza proves fruitful as I got what I envisioned there. Basically I got fiery colours this year: red and orange and both of them are from Blue Toms. (capture pictures later when I feel like it)

But what came to me as a surprise is that I finally found the perfect undies after a year! Or more like I think I know the criteria of what I wanted for a very personal and intimate piece of fabric. :p I think I’d much prefer Diesel’s Modal fabric ones: very thin (you would almost feel nothing), elastic, can fully enclose my jewels in its full glory… and can survive very well in the washing machine. Definitely preferred thongs and shorty (or boxer-briefs). Think that’s what I’d want to keep in mind.

Other than that… just was drained as I attended the countdown concert there. Think would need to go to sleep now.
