- It’s not about how much you are able to influence at one time, but rather how long it’s sustainable and how to maintaining momentum of continuing the influence.
- It’s not about getting the easy targets that comes towards you, but rather getting others spreading the influence on your behalf that is more important.
- … and it’s all about being able to see the bigger picture of things and having a grasp of the myriad of directions that they all move themselves to.
