Caught the typical flu + sore throat = that sucks.

Worse is that now the difference is that it was meaner, bad-er (intended to be grammatically incorrect :p) and had more attitude: instead of being cured after a day or two, it's already day four the symptoms just became worse. Not to mention that those symptoms cycles through like… sneeze fit for one day, then fever for one day, then coughing like no end on another… and so it goes.

Then there's the fatigue and phlegm-y coughs, and sore throats aren't easy to bear.

Blegh. That's never fun no matter how you look at it.

Anyway, still have to work somehow. But definitely I needed some rest.
