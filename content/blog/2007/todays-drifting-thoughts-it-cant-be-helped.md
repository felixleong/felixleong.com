Sometimes when it comes to the challenges that I'm personally facing now, sort of thinking "Is there something that can be done about it?" or that "It seemed can't be helped (but to face/avoid it)". At times I do wonder the "what if's" from the potential choices that I was given at different point of time. As much the outcome are way beyond my imagination anyway.

If I were not to be able to get the things I wanted from the path that I have chosen, does it make it a bad choice (or a mistake on my part)? Given the experience that I'm having now at that time, would I made a different choice?

It just appeared to me that it's impossible to make a completely informed choice at any point of time, from our limited perception and knowledge towards the things around us to the unpredictability and ever-flowing and changing circumstances and influences around us.

When it comes to the questions of "What am I striving for? What I intended to achieve?" the answer that I can give is probably based on my imagination constructed by my own limited opinions, perception, experience and understanding during my growth process. What guarantees of happiness can come from attaining the things that I wanted? Hard to say, really, as the things that I wanted may not be the things that they seemed to be.

From time to time, just so it happens that we felt that the grass are always greener on the other side, all because that we understood fully well every single flaw in every single blades of grass in our garden and standing from afar, all we can see is the big picture of other people's grass fields. But honestly speaking, probably it'll always look green because nobody wants to magnify all the miseries and sorrow to the world. Heck! Who would want to bother to see them, probably that'd scare people away, which creates an unwanted disadvantage to oneself. Therefore we tend to paint things that way, at least in a way that is socially acceptable.

Right now, I'm just taking extra effort to find the path, trying to do something which I had always wanted to do. Although I didn't have much faith in myself and what the future holds, but I were to deduces that everything around us doesn't have any worth, then what's the point of extending my own misery? As much there's no guarantee that I'll be able to reach my destination by doing the things that I wanted to do (with or without a choice), at least it'd take me further ahead than having myself rotting…

That's what I'm thinking at the moment.
