A few days ago I was chatting with Allen and we sort of come round about the discussion on the concept of love and self love. Although this is only part of the chat that we had, I think this portion has my arguments well formed enough to warrant a LJ post for my own reference. The user names are pretty self evident that no need for me to explain.

[Update @ 1:18am: This is the actual final version, been editing this error-prone log several times just now ^^||]

**(11:42:16) Felix Leong: well… but it's more of an emotional aspect than a physical one… or is it? ^^||  
(11:42:34) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: yeah  
(11:42:51) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: physical just going to the emotional ones**

(11:44:31) Felix Leong: if it's about the previous statement (note: see bolded statements): "may or may not be the case"  
(11:45:09) Felix Leong: (somehow i did notice that i like to use words like these ^^||)  
(11:45:56) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: maybe becuase either u are not sure or some doesn't apply to you?  
(11:46:48) Felix Leong: it's more like… it's sometimes the case, it's sometimes not the case  
(11:47:02) Felix Leong: but most of the time, it's kinda hard to make them cooperate ^^||  
(11:47:37) Felix Leong: they work on different sets of rules  
(11:47:48) Felix Leong: well… rules as in those imposed by others and ourselves  
(11:48:29) Felix Leong: it's not hard to notice that sometimes… social rules and personal views on "rules" often clash with each other  
(11:48:48) Felix Leong: ideally both physical and emotional should cooperate hand in hand  
(11:48:55) Felix Leong: i.e. the perfect harmony  
(11:49:10) Felix Leong: but it's much easier to live with a split personality  
(11:49:18) Felix Leong: that's how i look at it  
(11:49:50) Felix Leong: because it's "socially convenient" for us to be split within ourselves  
(11:50:11) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: as in multiple personality?  
(11:53:53) Felix Leong: part of it  
(11:54:18) Felix Leong: but it may take the form of just the typical "mask vs true self" scenario  
(11:54:35) Felix Leong: a personality split of the inside  
(11:56:53) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: true…i agree with that

(11:57:43) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: and most of it just to protect and held myself back becoz i sacre of people's judgement  
(12:00:02) Felix Leong: if you think of it rhetorically, if not living what you wanted to live is part of "not loving yourself", then should like "socially abiding" behaviour be consider as "self hate"  
(12:00:19) Felix Leong: well, it's also not an absolute argument  
(12:00:32) Felix Leong: but just wanted to drive to the possible point  
(12:00:41) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: i see i see  
(12:01:19) Felix Leong: that what i mean by really understanding the concept of "love"  
(12:01:49) Felix Leong: it's not as easily distinguishable and manageable as Gray's Love Tanks  
(12:02:04) Felix Leong: but his metaphor is a good starting point to explore  
(12:02:26) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: hmm… *processing*  
(12:02:58) Felix Leong: the concept of "self" and the concept of "love" have to be seen separately  
(12:03:20) Felix Leong: if you can't understand either side of the equation, "self love" is not something that you can achieve  
(12:03:37) Felix Leong: at least "knowingly"  
(12:04:17) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: hmm…ur theory start to make sense…

(12:04:44) Felix Leong: still an unproven theory on my part  
(12:05:44) Felix Leong: Gray's true essence has to be understood  
(12:05:47) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: it's true that at times u hving fun urself but u would still end up hoping the love from another  
(12:05:51) Felix Leong: i.e. between the lines

(12:06:25) Felix Leong: that's an important question

(12:07:13) ♪.59: Maiden of Tears: Gabriella: if it's not love then what it is?  
(12:07:25) Felix Leong: and once you really achieve it and you notice the fallacy (that that "love" is not really "love"), you'll start to doubt yourself, really  
(12:07:54) Felix Leong: "love", from our perception, is not really "love" per se most of the time

(12:10:36) Felix Leong: so… what is it that you'd call "love"?  
(12:10:44) Felix Leong: it's an interesting question to look into it
