title: Shopping Lists (Updated 1 January 2008)

Just a shopping list (more like a want list) to remind myself:

- ~~New pair of specs or contact lens, either one of the two~~ (Done: August)
- A couple of ~~working shirts~~ and slacks, ~~planning to get those iron-free ones~~ (Project: December; shirts bought @ November)
- ~~A new and comfortable pair of leather shoes~~ (Done: September)
- ~~Two to four extra shirts for next year’s CNY~~ (Done: New Year's eve)
- ~~(Want) Sony Ericsson K320i, probably I’d go for this model for its affordability and just-enough-functions that I need. Currently priced at RM400, hope I can get it cheaper somehow~~
- (Want) Nintendo DS Lite bundled with two games, one of them being FF3. That’d be a big bang out of my wallet so not sure whether I prefer to postpone it or not
- (Want) Attempt to complete my manga collection. Thinking of getting Juuni Kokuki novels as well

Those labeled with (Want) may not need to be fulfilled this year, but it’d be a great way to reward myself. (well… unless someone else buy those for me as a present, but usually that tends not to happen :) ).

*Note on Jan'08: I'm done with the shopping list apart from the slacks :D, which isn't that critical anyway*
