Life's going on as usual, with everything's OK on the outset. Is it that I became stronger? Or that I didn't really cared? Or I have gotten used to live with my heart wounded?

As much it's not being expressed in anyway, I know that small sadness that sounds like a whimper, that ache that seems to have everything ground to diamond dust… those familiar little feelings within.

*"…Life have to go on, no matter how the circumstances are at the moment…"*

Is it that I'm starting to get used to this kind of feeling? Or is it that I have endured the greatest pain way before yesterday: rehearsed to a point that it seemed more bearable?

*"… Am I more happier this way…?"* 

*"… If I were to move forward, where should I go…?"*

As much I'm already happy with whatever I have on the peripheral, what is it that I really needed deep down…? Somehow I felt out of touch with the happiness that I used to know. The heights I have reached before seemed so distant to me… as seemed starting to fade away from my memory…
