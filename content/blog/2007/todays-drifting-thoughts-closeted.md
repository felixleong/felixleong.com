Been doing some computer cleanup during the weekends, so probably you'll only see me soonest by tonight, if anything.

Other than that, I sort of wondered about my closeted behaviour, as in not acting and enforcing my own beliefs in the presence of others. Or in a way that I sort of slacked my own standards in some situations.

But anyway, I'll leave it at that at the moment. I wondered why the necessity of courage when wanting to come in terms of ourselves (of forgiveness and acceptance). From a logical point of view, it just appeared to be that the thing that we thought to be as "myself" is more than one entity, which does not make any sense from that point of view.

Since when that complexity came into the picture in my own life?

â€¦

Anyway, I got to work now.
