Just as a reminder to myself (which is also what has been constantly repeated in my brain):

By the time I’m capable to amass 500K in various assets, I’ll consider myself “retired” (or financially free). By “retired” doesn’t mean that I won’t continue to work and stuff, probably I’d say that by that time I’d be comfortable enough to tell myself “another day, another dollar”.

But honestly speaking, if I end up developing the habit of chasing the carrot in front of me, probably even by the time I reach that goal I’d never enjoy myself at all.

So in a way I do have to learn to keep my pessimism in check and enjoy what I have now. Probably just start by telling myself “another day, another dollar” (with the positive interpretation in mind).
