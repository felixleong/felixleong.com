… I mean, the things that surrounds me seemed to like to pick this few days to fail or break down.

At work, the phone system and email system decides to act up, and imagine work without email (which is the main communication channel in our company): it can either be heaven (e.g. YES! I don't have to get bothered with work related communications for a while) or a complete nightmare (e.g. OMG!!! There's a few urgent mails that I have to send out!!!)

Then the KL Monorail had a technical difficulty today which makes us wait for at least 30 minutes for a train to arrive, and trains that resembled packed sardine tins are definitely not comfortable (nor was the sea of commuters on the platform waiting at a hot afternoon either). Then the Kelana Jaya line was disrupted slightly a few days ago.

And I fried *yet* another modem, which means I'm having my third ADSL modem now. X_X And that pretty much means that I need to get a better surge protector. Damn.

Other than that, life is going on at an unrelenting pace right now. … And my shopping list (emm… "nice to have" shopping list) is showing a very scary trend right now. At least it's not my "MUST HAVE NOW!!!" shopping list otherwise I'd be finding myself in a budget deficit now.

But somehow it appeared to me that I'm starting to allow more mistakes to creep into my life? I find myself nervous with the outcome and sometimes being overwhelmed by them. At least for now, some changes had been occurring in own life and was shown in my own personality these days. Not sure whether is it towards the good or the bad, though.

By the way, my Japanese self-study is getting more rigorous these days and I was actually planning to start my Japanese blog soon :). Somehow was hoping that I'm able to really practice this language, at least in the online universe. See how I'm going to keep up with two personal blogs then.
