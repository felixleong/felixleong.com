Sometimes I got so fed up and tired that I wished that I won't get easily attracted to guys who are either "taken" or homophobic (even the degree of openness that "open and accepts to homosexuality of others but being completely defensive when homosexuals shows affection towards them" were in this category, if I were to really distinguish them). Probably I could have hurt deeper if I were not to cross "taken" guys from my list ever since Choon Hui's incident.

Although to be honest my approach to decline someone's feelings is not really all that considerate and nice -\_-||.

*sigh* I wonder what's missing from my approach? Maybe it's something that needs me to bump into more brick walls to gain experience?
