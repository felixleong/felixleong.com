*"Until now… my wish that my feelings would one day be reciprocated will come true… still remains…"*

Pretty much I'm on my own most of the time, trying to figure things out on my own along the way. Not that I got used to it or anything… it's more of the fact that I didn't have much of a choice… or at least I'm not aware of any alternatives. As much as I would like it to be otherwise, I was in the belief that if the opportunity was not present, I can't do much but to find where the opportunity or its alternatives lies.

*"Running and resting, again and again, that's how I'm living at the moment. Have I forgotten to stop not for the reason of a tired body?"*

… At this present moment, is it that the only thing I can do is to just hope and wait…, trusting that everything happens for a reason and time is needed for things to take effect and grow…?
