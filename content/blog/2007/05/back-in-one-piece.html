{% mark post -%}Touched down on Malaysian soils at 2:10pm today. Pretty much the rest of the day was get my stuff organized before I get myself worked up in this dimensionâ€¦ er, country? :p

My Cambodian travel log is not going to happen today as it's going to be a long one (and I haven't transferred my 2.5GB of pictures in my hard drive). Will write about it this week ;).

Till then, I need to head to bed and adjust my life cycle.{%- endmark %}
