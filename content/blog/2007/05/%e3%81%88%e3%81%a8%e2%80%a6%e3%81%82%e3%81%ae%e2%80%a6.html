{% mark post -%}Quite a coincidence today that I met and talk with a native Japanese tourist today. Just so it happened that I was waiting for the train to arrive and was flipping through my Japanese textbook and he sort of broke the ice with me. And it was pretty much the first time I actually converse in Japanese, although it's like… with my very limited vocabulary and grammar practice, I actually spent more time trying to decipher what he's trying to converse with me. Most of the Japanese coming out from my mouth are mostly broken Japanese anyway ^^|||. But we chatted throughout the journey and exchanged email addresses.

But it's definitely a good experience to me, and I'd definitely want to improve my Japanese further to a point of fluency :). Hopefully that wouldn't be that hard of a dream :).{%- endmark %}
