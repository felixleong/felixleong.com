Currently the main thing that has been pretty much bugging me at the moment is the issue of understanding and sorting out signals. Just personally find it pretty hard to differentiate such subtle matters, really: what it seemed may not be what it really meant. And there’s another noise factor as well: my own perceptions and emotions in relation to a particular situation.

Not really that I bothered about it most of the time really, but when it comes to something that I am attracted to, I personally find myself in a limbo of doubt and ecstasy. Withheld by past fears perhaps? Or I just need to be assured in order to really relax? But somehow without me taking the initiative to get concrete answers, that probably make things unnecessarily complicated… isn’t it? (but then again, there’s always that human insistence of getting the “timing” right)
