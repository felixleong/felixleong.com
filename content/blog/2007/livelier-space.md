title: Livelier Space?

At the moment the "territory" that used to be occupied by myself alone now has two new temporary (?) "inhabitants" (???!!! ^^|||) now: my cousin Jin is staying in the guest room next to mine and my sister now occupying the second bed in my room.

Meaning, less personal space for myself? But honestly speaking most of my time was spent outside, so probably it doesn't really matter, except for someâ€¦ well, trivial inconveniences? *cough cough* :p

But thinking in another perspective, at least for the time being my aunt have some company from the two. Thinking that way, that's a good thing.
