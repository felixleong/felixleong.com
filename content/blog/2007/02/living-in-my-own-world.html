… that has been one of my frequent comments when people asked how I was recently, which is indeed pretty much true in the sense that I don't really have a social life anymore. Most of my time was spent with my colleagues and my aunt and there aren't any life beyond that small circle of people. But even so, I was pretty much alone most of the time, not sure whether is it a reflection of who I am, or that I didn't know that I'm actually being left out for some reason, or some other reasons.

… Not that I'm really concerned, but I can't really ignore it either.

Anyway, that aside, yesterday was the presentation night (i.e. prize giving ceremony) for our programming competition, but nothing exciting happened. Like… nothing, at all. We went up on Friday, but almost throughout the two days I feel not physically well… well, more like very lethargic T-T. The weakening for my immune systems are giving me a hard time at the moment, almost felt like being dead. Still feeling like that today… meh.

… Probably I need some health boosters, sunshine and optimism… you know, to uplift my own well-being.

Today Aunt Ling and Uncle Vicent helped out to clear this house again, shoving away all unwanted paper material (basically printed materials from my late Uncle Chiew). Well… not really them doing the work, more like they ask the recycling company to come and they just kept an eye on them. A lorry with a capacity of 3 tonnes was brought over with three workers. And after hours of hard labour, the whole mountain (no kidding) of paper weigh around 1.6 tonnes! O_O||

I swear to myself that I shall never hoard stuff. But not sure whether my CD collection and books would count as "hoarding" XD.
