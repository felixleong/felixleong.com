Seems that the search is going to be intense… to search the unique "meaning" to life. Seeking to understand my own "semantics" and "views/perception", challenging every single "belief" that I had in the quest to search the "truth". An arduous journey.

Currently feeling "tired" to move on, "unmotivated" to do anything more. But do I understand the reason behind these "feelings" and "emotions", as finding myself taking long "breaks" and "rest" doesn't seem to help at all?

At this point… there's no way for me to know what my "future" will be…
