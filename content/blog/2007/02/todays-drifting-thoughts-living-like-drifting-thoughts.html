Been living as if I'm drifting afloat, trying to collect fragments along the way. Although from the outset it seems that nothing that happened, let alone a few slips of emotions… deep down I know there's that inexpressible feelings… nor would it bring much help if I expressed it anyway. Besides… how "emptiness" can be expressed?

What about those heart pricks? Not something anybody could help, I think… at most they can do is just to ease the pain a little. At most people is capable to "understand" how you feel, but not being able to "share" the pain… as "pain" is something individual and cannot be shared.

Somehow I'm thinking whether my concept of "dying" means "not turning back"… if that's the case, what's the thing that was to be "turning back from"? Somehow I can't figure out something "life fulfilling" that can be considered as a "place" that you'll not turn back once you reached.

Probably… I'm searching "my way home".
