{% mark post -%}Their so called: Singles' Awareness Day. Just got my package with Sweetbox's Adagio, We Love TechPara and Ultra's Stadium: just good timing as my valentine's day gift to myself. But I knew it's only much as a temporal gratification as worldly possession can do.

One thing for sure is that TechPara is certainly making me feel dizzy. @_@ It'd take some time for me practising to really get a gist of it. Definitely need to know how the generic song structure goes.

Somehow I have been thinking about the comment "Your smile seemed fake", this was commented to me from a few friends of mine over a span of years. As much I'm not sure whether is it like I have always been like that thing or it's just on that particular time frames that, it does contain some truth and I'm still unable to figure out the real reason via deep contemplation. But honestly speaking, even I was feeling an aching pain deep down, I don't really show them out in public… I don't know, sadness seems to me like a private thing and that wouldn't be much help if others aren't able untie that knot in my heart.

At the moment I was hankering for "love", but if it's something that comes on its own and there's no particular person who can provide it, all I can do is to continue my journey and find that… is it the only way… I'm sort of clueless in this aspect.{%- endmark %}
