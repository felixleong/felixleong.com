Finally! The first time I owned a Falcom soundtrack CD! :D Falcom J.D.K.BAND 1 arrange CD.

Sound Team JDK had always been one of my favourite video game music composer ever since I was exposed to Falcom game’s like 英雄伝説3:白き魔女 (was ported to PSP as [The Legend of Heroes III: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch][ed3]) and Ys II.

Anyway, here’s a sample of one of my favourite VGM of all time:
