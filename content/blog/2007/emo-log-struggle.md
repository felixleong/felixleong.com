Just keeping things short, at the moment I'm finding myself facing the worst enemy in my life: myself. Struggling with the challenges in work and my personal life is never easy, as much as I hate to admit that. And through these I saw the weaker, incapable and immature side of myself, something that I hate to see the most… yet I have to accept these shortcomings and try my best to overcome them was really a test of endurance and will power.

In times like this… is it OK for me to give up? But it's never going to solve anything but only to drive myself away and running away from life…

At the moment I was at a loss of what to do at the moment… or at least what I should do in order to go further ahead in my own life. Just felt as if my life is becoming stagnant… and I was a bit uneasy: whether should I bear with whatever pain that I had and hold on tight to the path that I'm walking now, or that should I be looking at other options from now on?

At this moment… my visions were already too clouded by emotions and despair…
