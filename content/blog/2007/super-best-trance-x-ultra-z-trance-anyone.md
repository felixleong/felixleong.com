Would anyone be interested to get a copy of Super Best Trance x Ultra-Z Trance? I accidentally double-dipped it in eBay :(.

Basically everything is in mint condition (no scratches with obi) and you can [check the tracklist here][tracks] (which is a non-stop mix album by DJ Kaya). It’s a promotional sample disc, though, if it’s of any concern to you.

I’m willing to sell it for US$5 and shipping cost will be US$7 to the US (registered airmail)… and probably less if you happen to live elsewhere :).

Let me know if anyone’s interested.

… Or perhaps letting me know where would be a good place to sell this would be of great help ^\_^.

On the personal side of things:

Just received my shipment of CDs again: this time to get [Mylin][mylin] and [Sweetbox][sweetbox] CDs and a bunch of trance music (mainly the Super Best Trance series) to sample with :). Still haven’t had the chance to seriously sit down and listen to them at the moment really.
