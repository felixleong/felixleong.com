Well… I haven't updated anything last week, but nothing worthwhile happened and I wanted a break from having drifting thoughts, so that's what happened. ^^||

Last Friday was our company's annual dinner and to be honest, well… it's… pretty… boring -\_-||. It's like… everything is just OK: we had our dinner at one good hotel, but it's not splendid; the food is nice, but they aren't special (just a typical Chinese 9-course dinner); the entertainment were nice, but I'm not awe-struck; the prizes for the raffle draw were expensive (at least the main prizes), but they aren't exciting. I mean, the whole event is just "good" but not great, IMHO… well, maybe I'm just expecting something more than that, I guess. If I were to count it as a blessing, well… I'm not that bad off either.

Ah well, at least I got a cash voucher for a branded clothing store, but more likely I have to pay some extra for it.

Anyway… been reflecting a bit, it strike me that sometimes… the way someone respond to me are just a reflection of part of myself, so whether I like that response or not, in a way, is pretty much like liking or disliking that part of myself. Thinking about it… somehow I just felt a bit envious with Yuan Hui and Seck Min (two of my colleagues), envious of that quality of friendliness and warmth that draws people close to them… envious of both the quality and the outcome that was brought with them, for that matter.

Feeling self-conscious myself, to be honest… probably feeling a bit defeated as well. Just those things I can't manage to do well myself, I guess.

Is there something wrong or missing in me? Well, that's something that I'd need to find the answer.
