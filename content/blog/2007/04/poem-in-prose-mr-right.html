{% mark post -%}或许，就是不断地
寻找着那个
自己无法达到的
那个“自己”

偶然的瞬间
遇上了
在你身上找到
“完美的自己”的味道

这是所谓的“爱”吗？
其实连自己也不怎么晓得
只晓得
拼命地去接近你
希望能够抓到些甚么
希望能够从你的观点视线中
看到什么色彩

但是…
世界不曾完美过

与你隔离的那一天起
从前你那笑颜未曾消失过
但也似乎回想起
隐约无法表露地伤痛

是我的错觉吗？
还是你也是在寻找着你的“完美”？

应该放弃吗？
应该绝望吗？
其实自己也仍然在犹豫徘徊着
究竟自己也不曾懂得
两人之间的同感

或许…自己真的是不懂吧…
或许…“爱”的，并不是“你”吧…


－ 给我对你的怀念而写，从中希望能够给予自己些不曾存在的安慰 －

Maybe, just restlessly
finding that
unattainable "self"

On that accidental moment
I found from you
that taste of the "perfect self"

Is it that's what it had been called as "love"?
Actually I'm didn't really understood myself
Only knew
to get close to you with all my might
Hoping that I'm able to grasp something
Hoping that from you point of view
(I'm) able to see some different colours

But…
the world was never perfect

From the day we separated
your smile in the past never fades away
But I seemed to remembered
that pain that seemed unable to be expressed

Was my senses mistaken?
Or that you are also finding that "perfect" of yours?

Is it time for me to give up?
Is it time for me to losing hope?
Actually I'm still hesitantly moving round in circles
After all I never knew
the mutual agreement between two persons

Maybe… I really don't know at all…
Maybe… what I "loved" wasn't "you" at all…


- Written for my yearning towards you, hoping to be able to give myself an nonexistent consolation in the process -{%- endmark %}
