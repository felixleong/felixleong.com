{% mark post -%}Let's see… that'd be getting my passport tomorrow, ask and make sure whether I got my income tax right and pay for it, cancel two cards…

Still having some problems in dealing with the anxiety I had when it comes to talk to people that I don't know. Although in a way that my job sometimes requires me to do so, I tend to get so anxious about it that I'd rather avoid them and let others help me with it. *rolls eyes* Yeah, I know… it's not really healthy, in a way: as if I see those customers/authorities were "scary". Not really sure whether experience and exposing myself to more people would be any help, I don't know, it just seems that I need some sort of handholding when dealing with people who are directly connected to your work performance (i.e. customers, bosses, users etc.). Talk about being insecure ^^||.

Probably it's just that nagging insistence to be "right" in front of others, as in doing things right, leaving good impressions… stuff like that. Just sometimes felt that the fear of screwing up was so great that I just want to hide away from them, I suppose.

*sigh*

Anyway, think better head to bed early today, need to get up early to avoid the crowd tomorrow.{%- endmark %}
