Yes! Finally! I got my CD collection all converted to MP3, which the whole conversion thingy took me like months to complete _o_.

Hope I'm not going to do the whole conversion againâ€¦ as much I'd prefer other more file saving formats than MP3s, it's still the universally accepted format for most portable players. So there, hope it'll still remain it's status as the de facto standard.

And after all the conversion, it comes out to be 18G O\_O||, that pretty much means that it would be wise for me to aim for the 60/80G models in the markets. But probably something that I would only buy soonest by next year.

Hope that my 15G iPod will last for a long time, I don't mind swapping and rotating albums once in a while anyway (after all, there's always albums that I don't find myself listening to anymore anyway).
