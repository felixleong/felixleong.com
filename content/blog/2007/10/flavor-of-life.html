These days I found myself quite attached to Utada Hikaru’s Flavor of Life -Ballad Version-. Still remembered clearly that by chance I watched Music Station on Animax and she enchanted audience with powerful vocals and emotions with this very song.

Personally this is one of the songs that resonates my current feelings at the moment. It kept on reminding me the painful lessons that when I don’t continuously try to reach out for that person, don’t continuously seeking a way to express whatever’s in my mind, I may never be understood at all and things may not have the chance to change. All the times I never get to say a proper “goodbye” and the feelings faded away slowly into my memories.
