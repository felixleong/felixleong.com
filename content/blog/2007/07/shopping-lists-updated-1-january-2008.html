{% mark post -%}Just a shopping list (more like a want list) to remind myself:<br /><ul><li><strike>New pair of specs or contact lens, either one of the two</strike> (Done: August)<br /></li><li>A couple of <strike>working shirts and</strike> slacks, <strike>planning to get those iron-free ones</strike> (Project: December; shirts bought @ November)<br /></li><li><strike>A new and comfortable pair of leather shoes</strike> (Done: September)<br /></li><li><strike>Two to four extra shirts for next year’s CNY</strike> (Done: New Year's eve)<br /></li><li><strike>(Want) Sony Ericsson K320i, probably I’d go for this model for its affordability and just-enough-functions that I need. Currently priced at RM400, hope I can get it cheaper somehow</strike><br /></li><li>(Want) Nintendo DS Lite bundled with two games, one of them being FF3. That’d be a big bang out of my wallet so not sure whether I prefer to postpone it or not<br /></li><li>(Want) Attempt to complete my manga collection. Thinking of getting Juuni Kokuki novels as well<br /></li></ul>Those labeled with (Want) may not need to be fulfilled this year, but it’d be a great way to reward myself. (well… unless someone else buy those for me as a present, but usually that tends not to happen :) ).<br /><br />*Note on Jan'08: I'm done with the shopping list apart from the slacks :D, which isn't that critical anyway{%- endmark %}
