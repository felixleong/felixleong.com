Sort of thinking about the term "thinking too much", the most common advice/reason (excuse?) that I have heard so far. It's like "stop thinking too much", the meaning seemed to be extremely vague… not to mention that the definition and scope of "thoughts" (as in "thinking") is not entirely "thoughts" as what I knew it.

At least it would be more accurate that to say that "stop worrying so much" (I mean, I do admit that I tend to draw a lot of worse case scenarios before committing to anything… which may indeed qualify for me worrying to a degree of mild paranoia), but not "thinking too much"? I don't know, it just didn't make any sense to me. I mean, I do understand the great qualities of calmness and peace, but it just don't appear to me that stop thinking would in any way cultivate such qualities.

It would be explainable in the sense that indeed worrying is indeed a mind phenomenon (hence "thinking" in a way was capable to cultivate such "worries" and "fears"), but I still don't think it's reasonable to condemn the whole of our brain capacity, isn't it?

That's how I look at it.
