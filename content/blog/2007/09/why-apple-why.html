Steve Jobs is evil, no doubt about it.

Not only Apple tempts me with their new iPod range, those guys are smart enough to put me in the dilemma of not knowing which is more important: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/whichipod/">160GB (i.e. bringing my whole music library on the go) vs. wifi + touch screen + coolness factor</a>.

Not to mention that their prices just shouts an offer that I can't refuse at all. ARGH!!!!

… At least lucky for me, my plans to replace my iPod is pretty low in my shopping list priority.

… For now, that is…
