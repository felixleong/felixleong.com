… Work is getting tiring… *thud*

Anyway, three weeks of work without rest (read: even weekends) starts to wear me out somehow, I woke up today with the feeling that it’s Sunday -_-||. Just for the sake of not missing a deadline (hence trying my best to make the department’s progressive payment happen), just felt as if I’m pushing myself too far.

Sigh… really hoped that the choice I had made is for the best of things…

Ordinarily I would say that I look forward to finishing my task and taking a breather, but knowing that more work lies ahead of me (and the urgency of it) just makes me weary. Does give me the feeling of screaming “When will all of this hell would end?!”

Till the meantime, just wish me luck and strength to pull myself together. And that I can conquer whatever challenges ahead.
