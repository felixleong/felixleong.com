{% mark post -%}At the moment, just feeling that my life is transitioning itself into a different chapter. I do have to admit that a fair bit of emotional shock has put myself into some deep thought during the times when I experience those great emotional turmoils.

Writing the previous drifting thought entry about attraction somehow had me shifting a completely different gear. And together with my conversations with Allen, that gave me a lot of room to contemplate about how I have progressed thus far, especially the times when I write in my LJ. A couple of times I sort of find myself in some sort of time warp, having events and my own personal emotions reflecting those I had experienced in the past: as if I was facing another "self" of the past.

Such scenarios does made me wonder, "What does it mean in growing up? What is maturity?" Somehow the real meaning behind these things eludes me. Only thing I notice now that there's bound to be things that is going to be repeated, the only lesson to learn is to be strong, open myself in the face of such challenges and continue to be aware to the lessons that is available to myself.

Which is one of the hardest things to do in a lifetime.

At the moment, I have my transition poem drafted but somehow there's quite a few major gaps here and there. In a way, those verses haven came to me yet, but these kinds of thing only happens when the time comes. But I'm settled with the theme and the title of my LJ.

That's why I write this post, I guess.{%- endmark %}
