Seemed that all the stuff that I'm striving for is part of my own construction plan of my world. But honestly speaking I'm pretty much living in one myself. ^-^||

I don't know, it just seemed that most of my time I'm either wandering around in my thoughts or that I gaze over beautiful scenery that surrounds me. But rarely humans (yes, the collective noun) was my point of concentration, except those within the 20m perimeter that would prevent me from some embarrassing bumping. But I didn't really take much notice on them, really.

Honestly the only time when I really paid attention to humans (damn it's starting to sound very… err, dehumanizing? XD) is when I was engaged with them in some way, usually due to the need of interaction, whether I like it or not. I mean, I'm still pretty much OK with my social and communication skills (at least to a minimum requirement for survival) and I have no problems dealing with people in general (provided they aren't nasty). Just that if nothing strikes me about a particular individual, I can only remember after several interactions with the person, at least thrice, I dare say. ^^|||

Therefore I didn't quite get myself caught in the habit of glancing around to notice any pretty face/body around, not that I don't feel attracted at all, just that passing beauty doesn't make an impression to me until I get to interact with the person in a personal sense.

… After thinking about it, I'm not sure whether I should ever complain about nice guys never come around me. ^^|||
