{% mark post -%}－就是因为有“需要”，有“想要”，所以才会去“寻找”。就因为大家“需要”的东西不同，世界才如此充满独特的冒险。－

所谓“最后的爱”，似乎明白一点点了。心中一向烦躁着得到得不到，在“爱”中其实这个问题不曾存在过。这个“存在”，心中感应得到，感觉得到就好了。

虽然已经遗忘了好多遍，当这感觉回涌的当时把他记住就好了。

虽然，或许，这段路上没有人会永久相随，继续放开心胸，继续让自己感应就好了。

就算是一点点也好。

<em>"It's because there's 'needs' and 'wants', therefore I still continue to "search". And because the 'needs' of everyone is different, that's why the world will still continue to be filled with unique adventures."</em>

That so called "last love", I think I'm starting to understand a little bit of it. That inner frustration that whether I'll be able to have it or not, in "love" this question does not exist at all. This "existence", as long my heart is capable to sense, to feel it, that's good enough.

Although I forgot about it many times, as long as I'm aware of it when it all came back to me, that will be good enough.

Although, maybe, if there's no one that will accompany me along my journey, as long as I continue to open my heart, continue to let myself to feel it, that will be good enough.

Even small efforts will be good enough.{%- endmark %}
