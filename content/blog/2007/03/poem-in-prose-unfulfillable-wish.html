<em>"… Is it that… what I wished for… is humanly impossible…?"</em>

Sensing the potentiality, but yet no guides on how to reach there…
Will you want to explore? Will you take that adventure?
At times it's only certain that I'll be lost in such a distant place
In the midst of nowhere
Rushing restlessly… directionless…
Lingering on things that seemingly able cling on to
Only to realize the millions of illusions around me

<em>"… What does it really mean… by penetrating deeply…?"</em>

Time and time again, finding myself forming ideas
Likes clouds on the sky, gathering at one time… dispersing in another
Finding myself mistaken things every once in a while
Times that I thought I knew,
then came times when invalidation tears everything apart
In the end, what do I really have?
Only the feeling of "absence" within me

<em>"… Isn't it love what I'm seeking for…? But why…?"</em>

Feeling like giving up at times,
Feeling like disappearing completely at times
Just to run away from this world that I had knew
But is it what I really wanted…?
After all, it is my greatest desire to seek
Trying to experiment with that possibility to reach there
Where am I now? Just the brink that I perceived as "reality"

<em>"… Was it something that I can seek from within?
Or was it something that I can only find from some certain human being
That is capable to illuminate me, reflecting what it is?"</em>
