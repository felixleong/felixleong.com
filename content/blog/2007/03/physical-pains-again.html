Blahâ€¦ not really in a good condition today. For some unknown reasons I felt my hamstring muscle being sore and tight since yesterday. No pain were felt when I was inactive but as soon as I walked around or something, it's just very uncomfortable (slight pain, but not really all that serious). Not to mention that I had some trouble peeing as I felt the muscles around my butt and hamstrings were being strained.

It's felt much better today, not sure whether is it because of myself exercising or not. :/ Think have to be more observant and careful this time round, and probably I think I'd be better to see the doctor if the problem persists or gets worse.

But anyway, today I just went up for a meeting at Genting Highlands, and for some reason it just gets more apparent that I didn't felt very healthy when I was up there for some unknown reasons. Probably some very slight motion sickness when I was going up the hill might contribute part of it, but I don't know, just the environment made me feeling sick physically somehow. And I was back here and feeling a slight headache/migraine or something.

Think it'd be better off that I head to bed now.
