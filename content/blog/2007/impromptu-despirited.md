昨天，一整天在颓废状态中。只是面对电脑屏幕，完全让自己投入于虚拟世界。总是觉得这样的生活，似乎没什么生气，死沉沉似的。那感觉到现在都依然如此，想着“这样的生存方式，真的要继续下去吗？”…就这么样的想法。

Yesterday, I was dispirited for the whole day. Only facing the monitor, letting myself immerse in the virtual world. I was always thinking this kind of life, seemingly without any much signs of liveliness. That feeling still persists until now, thinking "This kind of life, am I really wanting to continue it?" …that's what I'm thinking at the moment.
