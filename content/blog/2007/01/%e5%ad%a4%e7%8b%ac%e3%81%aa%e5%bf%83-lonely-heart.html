{% mark post -%}Been uber pessimistic today, still feeling as if a part of me had been missing… feeling lonely, perhaps? By all means, I still know that he meant a lot to me and having that distance between me and him still gave me the heartaches.

I know it sounded silly thinking that I'm still brooding over him whom had made it clear that he's not that "type" of person. This happening thrice made me feel even the more miserable. It's like… I wanted him badly yet I can't do anything as I don't want to manipulate the very person I like the most. It's just… that hard for me; and that I was hurting myself in order to protect his "choice".
