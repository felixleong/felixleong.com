{% mark post -%}While I was at the gym at 4pm, I suddenly noticed that I got red spots all over my arms when I rolled my sleeves. And I'm like O_O|| and noticed that there's spots on my thighs as well! (guess how much I freaked out).

So it's like… I sort of rushed out from the gym, after taking my shower. Went to see the doctor later but she said that I'd need to take a blood test tomorrow as she can't really determine the cause yet. But now, I notice that the red spots are starting to fade away. Hmm… I wonder whether is it just a allergy or not? I don't know, see how the spots turn out tomorrow :).

Other than that, just got ATB's The DJ in the Mix CD today and I'm getting all trance-y at the moment (pun intended?). Surprised that Ayu's M was in there (probably the trigger that I made me bought the CD?), still going through the CD at the moment. Probably getting Groove Coverage's best compilation CD soon, seeing that I only found one copy at the moment, think would need to snatch it before it's too late. (their new album, on the other hand, was easily available)

Not sure whether my current sound-scape expansion would cost me a lot though. Well… thinking of expanding it one at a time, slowly… at least with all the internet radio around, I'm not that worried :).

One last thing worth mentioning is that a frog/toad suddenly sprung out from the bottom of my computer desk. びっくりした (that surprised me!) I wonder how it came in… but I released it away anyway.

Think that's all at the moment.{%- endmark %}
