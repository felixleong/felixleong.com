So it seems that the year started of with several failures, currently with one system which I'm taking care of being phased out… I'm sort of feeling numb of all this. As if I'm already waiting for all the rubble to crumble down into a complete desert plane.

<em>"… How do you feel when you start to lose what you thought you can hold on…?"</em>

With this numbness, with my emotions being watered down to silence… the only thought in my head now is to wait until the dust settles down.

<em>"… What is it that I'm actually missing in life…?"</em>

Currently the questions that I have to ask myself, what lessons that I'm able to learn from this experience? What should I be doing now to change the situation that I'm in now? Where should I be looking at now…?

Definitely need a lot of reflecting, thinking and acting right now.
