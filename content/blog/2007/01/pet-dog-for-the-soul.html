Just wondering whether I'm better off having a pet dog, if all I wanted is some love, warmth and care. Probably I just wanted something that I can nurture and take care of (or am I just starting to get hopeless with humans? Eh heh heh ^^||).

Probably I was exposed to too many friendly dogs that came close to me without hesitation and liked to be stroked and touched for the past few months. I think I wouldn't surprise myself if I decided to adopt one, definitely will get one once I got to stay on my own. I think.
