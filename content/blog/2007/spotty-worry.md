The red spots are not getting any better, it was worse than I thought as I saw more of them on my arms and legs today. ;\_\_; Any without any itching or fever, that makes me a bit worried as I'm not sure whether is it a problem or not. (wellâ€¦ although ascetically it IS a problem)

Still having that internal debate on whether I should wait and see whether those spots will fade or that I go to the doctor tomorrow just to make sure.
