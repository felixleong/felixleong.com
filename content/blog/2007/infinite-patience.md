Sometimes I do wonder… whether infinite patience is needed to really obtain the final answer needed? Just now my comprehension ability is completely defeated x_x||… guess my own limitations was something that needs to be accepted and do whatever I think is best, I guess. Somehow I just felt that words and thoughts can both be a bridge and a hindrance to understanding. But probably our minds (ego, or whatever) were the actual hindrance? ^^||

Anyway, need to go to sleep now! Good night everyone!
