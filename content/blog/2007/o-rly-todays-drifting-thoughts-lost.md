Somehow I notice that my office phone extension number spells "O RLY", I'm just slightly amused, I would say.

Currently feeling all malnourished, the heart, body and soul: as if I'm drifting afloat somewhere in nowhere. Somehow everything I perceived was like clouds and bubbles in front of me, sometimes it was, sometimes it wasn't. Just felt like completely disconnected from life and there's nothing that I can really hold on to.

… Think I'm starting to have a breakdown… what outcome does it lead to… I'm not even sure myself. Just hope that my mind can still hold on in its autopilot mode until I found the answer within myself.
