Just got my little red book today, called the "Malaysian Passport" :). As much I don't think I'd travel much (let alone overseas), but probably would be nice to go out once in a while. Think would go to Singapore at least once :).

Anyway, just find myself whining and whining and whining ^^||. Not really much to complain about, really. ^^|| (as in there aren't really reasons for myself to whine apart from the problems that I brought to myself, really)

I'm in a complete financial wreck at the moment (and I pretty much did it knowingly), as if I'm making myself hard for a couple of months down the road (but honestly speaking I mean more to the fact that my splurge is going to eat into my saved travel expenses next month if I didn't exert some control) ^^|||.

But at least I crossed out quite a lot of things from my want list, so in a way the nagging feeling wasn't that strong as before ^^||. Hahaâ€¦ ^^|||||
