若是明知道是不可能的东西，为什么却是那么渴望去追寻呢？

是否品尝过一份刹那不可思议，就永远不打算回头呢？

这…连自己也不清楚吧。

If it's something that is known to be impossible, why I'm wanted to pursue it that badly instead?

Is it that I have tasted that momentary unexplainable feeling, and therefore decided not to turn back forever?

This… probably is something that I don't know of.
