It’s that time of the year again :) - reaching the magic number 25 (a quarter of a century) :p.

Anyway, no plans for today, so it’d be either very surprising (depends on what kind of plans that I or other people had in store) or very laid back (i.e. nothing happened). Anyway, I had [already bought my own birthday present]({filename}/blog/2007/click-click-snap-snap.md) with an addition of a very unexpected splurge, but I personally don’t mind pampering myself today within my own means :).

My birthday wish? Well, I had already made up my mind on that one (and not telling :p). But overall I am continuing to look forward with the wonderful journeys that life will be offering in times to come: cherishing every single up and down that continues to mold myself as who I am to become.
