Phew, after a full 10 day hiatus from the online world, I'm now back. Not that I'm dead or something ^^||.

OK, it's Chinese New Year all over again last Sunday and I went back to my hometown since last Friday. As for why I wasn't online during the time when I was at my hometown: first, I'm fed up with dialup speed; Second, I'm either out with my friends or in front of the TV watching anime ^^||. Probably a good experience as I get to detach myself from the cyberworld for a while.

I spent more time with my family this year, probably because there was less activities with my childhood friends. Didn't really get the chance to reunite with my friends, honestly speaking, save the minor few whom I consider as best friends (or those whom I kept closest in touch). Emotionally speaking there were times when I find myself in the blues, as I'm still living without great motivation, in a way. (most of the stuff are covered in my LJ) It's still about love and finding the "truth/meaning of life", if anyone didn't get it.

Been watching Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with my brother (as he recommended it) and I was totally blown away by the deep philosophical content and the great animation quality. I definitely feel for the Tachikomas, probably being able to relate with them even. I'll be watching it again soon to digest them and put some thought about them.

Anyway, that's all for the time being. Will continue my daily update from now on ;).
