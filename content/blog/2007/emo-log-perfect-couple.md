是否有想象过，渴望着“完美的情人”呢？一段似乎天衣无缝的恋情呢？

虽然如此想过，却始终无法成为你的完美。或许永远无法达到你的条件吧？或许早已经伤痕累累，最多也只能成为你的负累吗？

试问自己有那一天没想过你？似乎没一天不为现实感到无奈。似乎每一天都为别人能够轻易地从你身上得到我想要的东西而感到又羡慕又妒忌。

是自己无能吗？还是有些东西真的是可遇不可求？或许是后者吧，究竟还是不能勉强或命令人家的东西。

是真的很不甘心…

在这种状况中，自己能够做些甚么呢？希望些奇迹似乎太奢望了吧…希望这另一个“他”的出现也不是一样吗？

那所谓“爱”的养分，仍然还是寻觅着…

Did you ever imagined and desired "a perfect lover"? One love that was seamless?

Although I have thought of that before, but I never be able to become your perfection. Maybe (it's because) I'm unable to fulfill your requirements forever? Or that I'm already scarred all over, at most I can be is your burden?

Trying to ask myself, when I never thought of you? It seemed that there's no one day that I didn't felt helpless towards reality. It seemed that everyday I felt jealous about the things from you that I wanted badly which are so easily obtainable by others.

Is it that I'm incapable? Or that there are things that can only be met but never be demanded? Maybe it's the latter, after all it's something that cannot be forced or commanded from others.

Really felt completely discontented…

In this situation, what I can really do? Wishing for a miracle maybe was a bit too much … and wasn't wishing for the appearance of another "him/her" the same?

That so-called nutrient of "love", until now I'm still trying to seek…
