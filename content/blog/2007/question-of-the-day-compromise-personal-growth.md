What "personal growth" was to me when there's no road maps and place markers in front of me? What does it mean by "compromising myself"?

Albeit being two different questions, somehow I just felt there's some sort of connection between the two. Wellâ€¦ I couldn't feel "compromised" if I don't have some sort of idea of the value of the things that I had, isn't it? (you can also say things like vested interest, personal ego, etc.)
