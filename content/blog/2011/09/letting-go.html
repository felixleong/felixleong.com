<em> to someone that is so beautiful and dear</em>
<em> and unable to grasp and hold it close</em>

<em> My gaze remain locked</em>
<em> at this beautiful thing</em>
<em> swimming about gracefully</em>
<em> without any concern of the attention it receives</em>

<em> I clasps my hands together</em>
<em> On one hand, it's as if I'm begging</em>
<em> for it to come to me</em>
<em> While on the other, letting my internal tensions</em>
<em> fade away through my fingertips</em>
<em> slowly, gently, with ease…</em>
<em> and to let it go…</em>
