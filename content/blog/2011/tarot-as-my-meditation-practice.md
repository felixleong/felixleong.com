Here's one unimportant fact that I never really divulged to anyone yet: I do tarot readings.

It's not one of those skills that I practice daily. I do tarot readings exclusively for my benefit, mainly for one of the two possible reasons: either to seek guidance from the unknown or the subconscious; or as a means of having a lens to reflect upon.

To the skeptics, it may very well be an irrational act - one that appeals to my own primitive instincts to seek out patterns and retrofit whatever I perceive what the cards are showing, so to make sense something that's totally random to begin with. In my experience, however, it doesn't feel to me that way. Having done readings for more than eight years, there's something that really appeal to me as the combinations of these cards always seem to carry a message that resonates with me to a certain degree.

And the particular fact that I unknowingly pay attention to certain cards more often than others - maybe due to the frequency it is being presented to me or the fact that my eyes are just simply drawn towards them every time they are shown. And often times those cards usually be a representation of an issue that I have yet to acknowledge, accept and act upon.

I couldn't particularly describe the feeling, it is the same feeling that I felt when I wrote a great introspective blog post: that I feel the energies flow through me and all I'm doing is to channel this energy and manifest it in a way that solidifies its form. The message always feels as if they aren't from me but from a higher power or an unknown source. And that message that's manifested through that process gave me a reassurance, peace and calm.

It almost felt like a spiritual exercise and it is an instrument that I use in my own short meditation practice. It's kind of like a beginner's crutch for me to have something in front of me that acts like a goal, in this case to decipher my perceptions towards it, so that I'm able to direct my focus, calm my senses and slowly letting the inner peace sets in. And then silently tune into what's within me: the energies that flows, my intuition and subconscious, the unknowns and the other things that I couldn't find words to express. I may want to call it the Flow.

Guess that pretty much describes one aspect of myself that I find to be central towards my own spiritual development.
