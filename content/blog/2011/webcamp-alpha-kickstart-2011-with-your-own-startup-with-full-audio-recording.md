Recently I'm totally into [Webcamp KL][wckl], an active community and unconference event with people who are passionate about anything web/Internet.

Yesterday's monthly event is a total blast with successful entrepreneur and angel/scout Chris Hong and two founders of a young startup called [Wootfood][wootfood], TJ Tee and Clayton, sharing their lessons and experience in building products and successfully launching their startups.

I have the whole session recorded using my iPod Touch and quality is surprisingly good as a guerrilla recording device. If you are interested in startups, [download and listen to the full, 2-hour audio recording][ep].
