When life becomes tough and I feel like grumbling about the inconveniences and roadblocks that is in front of me, it's necessary to remember that I should be seeing the situation from a different vantage point.

With a little bit of detachment, a different viewpoint and maybe with a sprinkle of imagination, life is beautiful after all.{%- endmark %}
