I drew the panda â€“ at least that's something small that I'd brag about :p.

And yeah, as much as they are so stealth that I don't know the details, if you are using email to handle support queries, [you'd be interested in joining the mailing list at http://sapo.to/](http://sapo.to/) for an upcoming solution for your support email hell.

Knowing the team behind it, it's definitely going to be really exciting! :D
