I was interviewed on BFM Radio together with Wu Han during noontime today :) â€“ talking about [Webcamp KL](https://www.facebook.com/groups/webcamp/), which is a community that I'm actively participating in.

During the show, we talk about how Webcamp KL got started, what makes Webcamp valuable and our mission to nurture a community of great people who are passionate about technology.

Check out the full interview below. My part kicked in at the latter part of the show as I let Wu Han be the main spokesperson during the interview. :)
