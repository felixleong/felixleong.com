{% mark post %}For the past month, I've been giving two talks about my experience in organizing meetups. This is the first of the two talks given, titled **"Introvert's Guide to Starting Your Own Tribe"**.

In this talk, I share about why I believe having a tribe of fellow empowering individuals could change your life and I break down the process of how you form a mastermind group.

And yes, I greatly believe that introverts are awesome! :D

## Coming Soon

I'm currently writing the expanded version of the talk and going deep into describing the process and tools that works while I'm organizing these smaller meetups. Hope that this project will see the light of the day in the end :).

My second talk, **"The Big Bang Theory: Nine Steps To Build Your Meetup Empire"** gets up a notch while I look back and share my experience in helping [Wu Han](http://twitter.com/ngeow) in building [Webcamp KL](http://webcamp.my/) to what it is today.

I already had the slidecast version on Slideshare, but if you want a video version of it, please be patient since I need to edit the raw footage.

If you have any feedback or questions, feel free to [reach out to me via Twitter](http://twitter.com/felixleong) or [Facebook](http://facebook.com/leongsh).
