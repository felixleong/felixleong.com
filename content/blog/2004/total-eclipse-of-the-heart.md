Hot damn this song seems to grow in me so dramatically that it always makes me wanna cry. :) It's just a beautiful song, I somewhat recalled that I have listened to the original on the radio when I was a kid, and never knowing that it'll make me like it so much. :) Think I really need to dig the song out from somewhere, at least the original :). [It's in my Ultra Parapara Dance Nonstop Megamix CD, by the way]

Anyway~ The lyrics~

## Total Eclipse of The Heart (Eurobeat Version) / Nikki French

*(Original by Bonnie Tyler)*

Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and  
you're never coming round.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of  
listning to the sound of my tears.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous  
that the best of all the years have gone by.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified  
and then I see the look in your eyes.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and the I fall apart.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and the I fall apart.

Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit restless  
and I dream of something wild.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless  
and I'm lying like a child in your arms.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and  
I know I've got to get out and cry.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look  
in your eyes.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and the I fall apart.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and the I fall apart.

And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever.  
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever.  
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong.  
Together we can take it to the end of the line.  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark.  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.

I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight,  
Forever's gonna start tonight.

Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I'm only falling apart.  
There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.  
Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there's only love in  
the dark.  
Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart.

Turn around, bright eyes…  
Turn around, bright eyes…

Turn around…  
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always wanted to be.  
Turn around…  
But every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me  
the way that I am.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and  
wondrous as you.  
Turn around…  
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better, there's nothing  
that I just wouldn't do.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and then I fall apart.  
Turn around, bright eyes…  
Every now and then I fall apart.

And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever.  
And if you only hold me tight we'll be holding on forever.  
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never be wrong.  
Together we can take it to the end of the line.  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark.  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.

I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight,  
Forever's gonna start tonight.

Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I'm only falling apart.  
There's nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.  
Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there's only love in  
the dark.  
Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart.  
A total eclipse of the heart, a total eclipse of the heart.

Turn around, bright eyes,  
Turn around, bright eyes, turn around.

I'm currently working on a choreograph for the song :). I just need the nail down the chorus, b-melo and c-melo (and GOD it's tough XDDD).

Working for three weeks let me notice something: I feel so naked without sleeping with a blanket :'(.

Will be going back to my parents' place today <333. So I'll keep you guys updated.

Lastly, I won the MHNNR11 CD~ Bweeee~~~ <333 (Babe Follow Me, you're my loving destiny~~~)
