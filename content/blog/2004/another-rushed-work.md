Shouldn't have procrastinated, the assignment came out to be rushed as well X(. Well… at least I manage to pull off an 18-page report within 7 hours. o.o" Anyway, the reports is about handling criticism without negativity, by the way. Kinda interesting when I ploughed through all the material I found.

Anyway, Steven have been acting odd today, it's not the usual, cheerful self. He kept questioning about friends and betrayal kinda stuff, but he didn't told me anything about it. Well… you know, those pessimistic views such as "Friends are only to be used" kinda stuff? (well… as much as I admit they do hold some truth) I suppose it has something to do with some sort of betrayal from his house mates or something, but I can't seem to get any information from him. Oh… well… -\_-" I really hope that he could get over that soon, because I don't think I'm able to handle his emotions in extremes.

Hmm… what else… Well… don't expect much stuff about Choon Hui lately since I really can't seem to get his attention, or having any friendly chit-chat lately ;\_\_\_\_\_\_; (But I suppose this is good news to those who got fed up with my Choon Hui related post… whatever). Seems that he's really putting much more attention onto assignments… he's really the kind of person who put 100% of his attention to the work he dedicated to and loved.

Just feeling lonely when I miss people. Anyway, I think I better don't think too much… and I almost forgot that I have forgotten to take my shower. :p
