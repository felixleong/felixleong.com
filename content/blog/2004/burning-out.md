Gah~ I just want to cut this short: SCHOOL IS KILLING ME!!!!
(Okay, I only needed the tension relieve. And… *take a deep breath* there)

Anyway, I just added a lot of virtual Post-it notes on my desktop reminding me every single deadline and you don't really want to see my desktop covered with canary yellow rectangles. As for now, I try to get everything out of my way and get over with it. Darn… I'm in total panic now, hope I'm able to keep myself in one piece as long as I can hold it.

Wish me luck then…
