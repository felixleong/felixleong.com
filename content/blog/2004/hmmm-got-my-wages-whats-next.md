Hah! Yay for extra cash <333! (Got it from Dr Tay for the data cleaning stuff)

So now I had RM350. I was planning to get PPP6 and 7 soundtrack, but due to the currency exchange rate, that'll definitely bang me about RM250+ for those O\_O". Ouch… Too bad YesAsia didn't stock them, I'm now trying to contact them and see whether they take custom orders.

For now, I'm planning to use 75% of it for CDs and books and shove the other 25% away for savings.

In other news, it's just… Tuesdays (i.e. least lecture hour day). Nothing much happening except for the usual. Something that left me ponder is that Erika says that she respects me being able to have time for fun and work. Hmm… I never knew that, because I know I'm REALLY lousy at time management. But… she might be right that I'm able to separate play and work, but that's only because I always leave work at the last minute XDDD. But I enjoy what I'm doing now ;).

Till then, let's see what I can find in ebay, perhaps I might get ayu-ro mix for myself :).
