Just after taking my nap, guess what? All of a sudden I got all those sneezes and sore throat which comes from NO WHERE! Guess the culprit's the hot weather X(. I wonder whether they have Think Geek got any plushies for bacteria/germs/virus which causes sore throat? >.>

Must remind myself to drink barrels of water (it usually works wonders, as much as it means that I'll be taking frequent trips to the loo)

Only two hours of class tomorrow, which is quite nice. But I got an assignment to hand up tomorrow, so that cuts the fun in half. Not to mention that I get less time to see him. Meh…

[:: UPDATE with Random Stuff ::]

Oh! They DO have one there: <3
