Just when you think things can't be any worse, it's going to bite you back. That's what happened to me on a Wednesday morning… which turns out to be pretty… bloody. Basically I was rushing to school and I noticed that I forgot my keys, so I ran back into my room, didn't notice that the glass door of my room is still closed, and I bang right on the glass door. Just for some additional drama, the glass broke over the knee level and the glass cracked and shatters on the top part, which ended up having a deep cut on my arm.

I didn't feel any pain… just shock. And just to keep things short, thank god I live with my aunt, and she's a nurse, and I went to the hospital later for 6 stitches. And that day was my assignment due date… ;\_\_\_;.

I cried… really hard that time… not because that I feel any physical pain (in fact, I didn't feel any)… but a dash of hopelessness, helplessness, blaming myself for keeping the most important stuff till the last minute… My worst fit of feeling failure in my life, which is no fun.

Two days of the ordeal wasn't being easy for me, I still need to do my assignments, even with an injured arm. But all my family and friends have been extremely supportive, Vico and Erika even come to that extent to pay me a visit, which is extremely touching to me. And Steven has also been extremely helpful in times of need. ^^ And a lesson well learnt is that I shouldn't keep things till the last minute, and learning how to takes things a little bit easier… and to cherish the people around you, they really have made my day.

Choon Hui never knew what happened to me until I met him today, but he looks glad to see me back after 2 days of absence, and that really made me feel warm ^^.
