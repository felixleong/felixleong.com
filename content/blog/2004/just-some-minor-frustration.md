Since the "dialup friendly" version of PPN2 is like… 90MB, so I decided to kill the school's bandwidth instead XDDD. But just before I finish with the download, the lab closes ;\_\_\_\_\_;.

Ah well, maybe I'll get it on Monday. *shakes fists*

And… my Maharaja Hi-NRG Night Revolution 11 CD haven't arrived yet ;\_\_\_\_\_\_;. How long should I wait for that… *whimpers*

[p/s: On a brighter note, eternal dream sucked me in almost instantly :D. *Plays it again and again* <3333]
