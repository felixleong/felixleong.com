Hmm… Another entry…

Anyway, been to Sunway Piramid alone just now: which is an activity that I always engage in… Sometimes I just prefer to stroll around alone, so that I can bring my mind, heart and soul for a stroll as well without the need to giving attention to others: pure undivided attention onto myself. 

I am thinking of buying Koda Kumi's 1000 Words single (which I used to saw one copy there months ago)…. However I can't find it ;\_\_\_;. Originally I was thinking of not buying anything, but suddenly one of the CDs in the budget corner caught my eye: dream's *eternal dream* CD. Honestly, I personally didn't like dream that much (well… at least I don't really like their SEB remix album), but it just seem to call me to buy it… and pretty reluctantly I got that CD.

Heh… I wonder how many times I have spent money like that…

Later on… I flipped through the lyrics pages… and suddenly… my heart seems to be painted in sky blue… I wonder… the lyrics seems to resonate in myself, seeming to reflect on myself somewhat. The feeling wasn't that strong compared to the time when I bought Ayu's albums, however… just a feeling of nostalgia.

…

Went to enjoy pizza later for dinner, sitting at the same spot… Looking out the window, I seem to see his face… the same illusory image: that he was sitting just in front of me, giving me the very same smile with a dash of shyness… And everything just wasn't there after a blink of an eye… I don't know… All I know that everything never happened, all is just an illusion which reflects on my very own desires.

My heart is painted sky blue again.

…

I just seem to notice, everything has changed in an extremely subtle way. I seem to feel slightly detached from my own environment. Is it that I have been focusing too much on my own internal spiritual development? Or is it that I have broaden my horizons (with work and stuff)? Or is it that… I'm just growing up?

… Keeping myself aware… keeping my eyes open…

… A sense of strength blossoming from a sea of blueness…

I smiled… it's kinda funny that all of a sudden that I seem to understand it, and yet in other times I seems not able to comprehend anything at all.The process of learning how to learn… as well as learning how to unlearn… What a beautiful thing.

Anyway, I have another 2 1/2 hours till I'm officially entering day two in my 23rd year in life.

Till then, cheers! :)
