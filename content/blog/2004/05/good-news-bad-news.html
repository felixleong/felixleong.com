{% mark post -%}OK, good news and bad news for today:

The good news is that I passed all my papers. The bad news is that I passed the paper I think I will fail.

Greatâ€¦ Now I guess I had a D which will drag my CGPA down into oblivion. If retaking a subject is a possibility in the future (which is currently not), I think I&apos;ll take another shot at it.

For now, I think I&apos;ll stay at home for another week.

- First time I ever used "bitchy" for my moodâ€¦ yeah, I do feel that way now >:o!{%- endmark %}
