Sometimes I just wondered though: are dreams something that reflects a person&apos;s desires and feelings? Recently I have been having dreams of being loved, having close intimate relationships, having passionate hugs… Hmm… perhaps it does reflect my desires to a certain extent, but having them frequently does shows an alarming sign… Or maybe I&apos;m just exaggerating things again?

Usually after having those dreams, I&apos;d have woke up all refreshed and elated (Yay for a thesaurus, learned a new word today). This time… some sort of loneliness looms in me… I&apos;m feeling so bad, I just refuse to wake up in hopes that either the dream continues or I&apos;ll sleep the loneliness off. So… Yeah, I miss all my lectures for today ._.".

Well… luckily this is just the second semester. I just hope that this kind of habit doesn&apos;t continue, last semester is a total train wreck and I need to learn my lessons this time.
