Well… it&apos;s four days I&apos;m at home now. And it seems that being at home is a good way to be totally unproductive, I have been sleeping on the couch almost the whole day today. Well… not really, but almost.

Anyway, I have been digging into my sister&apos;s manga collection, and read a few mangas which I wanted to read a long time: Tsubasa 翼 (latest manga by Clamp) and Fruit Basket. And Clamp have yet to fail to impress me in terms of artwork and storyline. Perhaps it was the most complex and captivating storyline by Clamp thus far, it&apos;s a really good read. Fruit Basket is totally hilarious, I only knew about it when my sister&apos;s friend burnt the anime for her. :p

Other than that, I did do some work today, I have sent a renewed draft screen shot to Sherman for the pixel art job… I believe that more work needs to be done, but I hope a few more artwork would land me the job, well… at least I will have some extra cash to pay for my CDs and possibly an iPod. Not to mention that I&apos;ll be able to pave my path towards my dream job. Well… just wish me luck :p
