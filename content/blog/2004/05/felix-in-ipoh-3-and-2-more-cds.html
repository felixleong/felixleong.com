OK, let&apos;s mention the CDs first which I just got from a shop during my trip to Ipoh (more on that later): SEB presents HYPER EURO MAX and SEB presents EURO global (and I got the last copy, MWAHAHAHA, I&apos;m evil :p). I haven&apos;t listened to EURO global yet, but I just finished with HYPER EURO MAX, and there&apos;s good news and bad news. The good news is that the CD is really good! The bad news is that if you have owned SEB100, you&apos;ll notice the 3 MAX tracks is TOTALLY similar (OK, I should have said that it&apos;s TOTALLY the same with *really* slight enhancements) to the ones in SEB100&apos;s J-Pop Remix Special CD (namely 閃光‐ひかり‐のVEIL, Love impact and Ride on time), with different titles. What a rip-off! I was expect at least a totally new remix, and no~~~ Not to mention that the CD is *less* than an hour (close though). Well… at least the other tracks are really spectacular that covers my rants under the hood. Ah well… Perhaps lemme just pop in globe&apos;s CD instead now.

Enough of the CD stuff, let me just flashback a bit. Anyway, I decided to go to Ipoh today, which is a big town next to my home town (Kuala Kangsar), just to scrape any CDs that I would want, and as well try to see whether there&apos;s any paralist around. So there I go, exchanging buses to go from mall to mall, and stroll around to see whether is there any new stuff around. Well… to my disappointment, well… nothing changed :p. And yeah, that&apos;s a bit boring.

But in Ipoh Parade (one of the bigger malls there), I accidentally bumped into a poster of Wind Dance Group, one of the paralist groups in Ipoh. I do feel a bit suspicious since I saw the *exact* poster last year XD (which is still the same ol&apos; stuff printed on A4 paper). Well… there&apos;s phone numbers listed there, so I just messaged them and didn&apos;t expect a reply (especially when you just can&apos;t seem to get any signals. Stupid DiGi [<< my cellphone operator]!). And I did! XD

But I do have to wait until 4:30 to actually see them in person. But it&apos;s fun anyway, you know, having someone to dance together and stuff *^^*. Too bad they have to leave at 5. Anyway, they do invite me to come over tomorrow… Hmm… buying two CD has already banged my wallet hard. Ah well… I guess I might pop up tomorrow to promote our message forums ;).

Anyway, hope that tomorrow will be fun ^^.
