{% mark post -%}OK, rants first, here&apos;s my results… with commentaries (which is REALLY bad):

<i>Operating Systems (B)</i> << Now I hate the lecturer even more
<i>Multimedia Technology (A-)</i> << Expected. And thanks to those who liked my Para flash animation/assignment. ;)
<i>Database Systems (B)</i> << OKAY~ What went wrong with this one >:(

<i>Discrete Mathematical Structures (B+)</i> << Not so bad considering the last minute work I had done
<i>Numerical Analysis and Mathematics for Computer Graphics (D)</i> << as expected X(… I think I&apos;ll be retaking this one if I got the chance
<i>Malaysian Studies and Moral & Ethics (Passed, grades unknown)</i>

With disappointing results like this, my CGPA now stands at 3.1092 (based on my calculations), which threads along my "acceptable" results level (obviously 3). Oh I&apos;m going to rant like no end if I kept on. Guess I only had myself to blame for that ;_;.

And to make matter worse, here&apos;s the subjects we are taking this semester:
- Software Engineering Practice
- Object-Oriented Programming Techniques
- Advanced Artificial Intelligence (this is going to be fun ^^)
- Interpersonal Communication
- Entrepreneurial Skills & Business Ethics (the other elective being Organizational Behaviour which I didn&apos;t sign up for)
- Cryptography

What&apos;s worse is that every single subject contributes into the GPA (unlike last semeseter with Malaysian Studies and Moral & Ethics), that means that I&apos;m going to sacrifice my social life and sleep to gain back the lost grounds. And… not to mention that I&apos;m going to have extra responsibilities if I got the pixel artist job (I really want the job o_o")

Looking at the bright side of things, it&apos;s a new semester, and my other friends in related courses who have been disappeared for industrial training has returned. Which is a good relief. But that also means that the campus is now officially packed with students (oops! I wasn&apos;t suppose to go back into rant mode). And Dr Tay (professor and my unofficial supervisor for the time being) tells me that the school is now having one lab specifically for final year students, and there&apos;ll be NO adminitrative restrictions set in the computers so that we can try whatever we want with them (of course, provided that we have to take good care of them). Yay! *rubs hands*

And to my surprise, some of my friends has signed up to study here. Well… at least I have something or someone to look forward to. Tutorial groups has been restructured and I&apos;m glad that some of my previous and disappointing assignment group members are not in the same group with me. Hah! That&apos;s great! Hopefully I can get better group members this time.

Been browsing into regional sites for avextrax, which means Hong Kong and Taiwan. So in case you get any CDs distributed by them, they are legal ;). Just look for the blue avex logo ;).{%- endmark %}
