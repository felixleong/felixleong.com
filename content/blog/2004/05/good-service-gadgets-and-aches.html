I was complete frustrated when the keypad of my cell didn&apos;t work as it should during the past few days, which means only one thing: it needs to get repairs. And the worst part of it: I lost my receipt for this new, second-hand cellphone. So yeah, it&apos;s that frustrating.

So I sent it to the repair shop and he charged me RM60 for a spoilt IC which tracks the key presses (see, I learn something new today :p), so adding to the cost I got the phone, now the total cost is as close to a brand new phone of the same model. Gah! Well, at least it works like a charm now.

But I&apos;m not totally in a gloomy mood today, thanks to all the good service that I had received. First off, I went to the bank to withdraw some cash to pay my tuition fees, but I forgot that I can pay the bill in the same bank as well. So once the bank teller signal me to get the cash, I sheepishly take out the bill and tell him I need to settle the bill with the withdrawn cash. And he goes like "Why don&apos;t you mention earlier?" with no signs of blaming in his tone and gave me a smile, which somewhat made me feel relieved ^^".

Then it&apos;s the person who repaired my phone, he&apos;s really kind (but of course, I might as well suspect a higher service charge compared to elsewhere… :p. Well, guess I need to ask around for any cheaper repair shop). And I got my phone in an hour, so yeah, that&apos;s cool. And after that, I went to the computer shop and got myself a new laser printer! ^^ The store assistance are being helpful and patient while I bombard them with tons of questions and stuff. And so I got myself a new printer.

Back at home though, I realised that I forgot to ask whether they would supply a USB cable for the printer… and apparently the printer doesn&apos;t come with one! Ouch! Luckily I had a cable from the spoilt inkjet printer, and I have to rearrange my table to accommodate the large printer. So now all my stationery is on the right side, while the printer is taking up half of the table on my left.

Now I&apos;m pretty much in a printing frenzy now, you know, printing stuff that would have took me ages to print with a normal inkjet. (read: e-books and tons of tech articles) And yeah, that was fun while I&apos;m experimenting with the various features of the printer. Hmm… I seriously think that I need to buy another ream of paper.

And oh! Carrying a 10kg+ printer while taking public transport is not funny. I&apos;m having aches on my arms and my back. Yeouch!
