I woke up in the morning today feeling all warm and fuzzy. Hmm… that&apos;s something, I only tried waking up either fresh or sluggish, or perhaps embarrassing once (don&apos;t try to guess what happen XD), but never once I ever feel all loved. It&apos;s so enjoyable that I&apos;m doing my morning routines with total bubbliness while trying to pore through my brains and remember what I dreamed yesterday. And halfway on my way to school, I suddenly remember what I dreamt:

I dreamt that Bean (read: the ex-… umm, crush that I have been mentioning throughout the whole journal) giving me a really intimate hug. And in one attempt that I noticed someone is watching and I&apos;m trying to push him away, but he still didn&apos;t let go, and give me a really warm and loving smile, hinting me that it&apos;s OK. And throughout the whole dream, I feel all loved and a feeling that I finally got something I have drool for a long time.

Yeah, perhaps I&apos;m just easily satisfied of things which I feel that I&apos;m deprived from :p. Well… guess I got my wish, as much it&apos;s brain-signals generated.

And yeah, I&apos;m back at school now, pretty much doing my downloading spree. It&apos;s been quite a while I&apos;m totally disconnected from a broadband connection, and now it&apos;s time for me to catch up every single para video which I missed. And my notebook is being a total idiot today by crashing due to overheating. So yeah, it&apos;s really annoying.

While I&apos;m still sitting in the corridor cruising along the digital highway, I bumped into a few friends. Heard from Yen Hock, who is also a house mate of Bean (ahem), that his house has been broken in and all their computers, including Bean&apos;s notebook, has been stolen. My heart sank a little when I heard that (and his name). Then caught up with the latest exams news, with some shocking news that some of the elite students failing papers. Ouch! After that, one freshie approach me with lots of question regarding this university, studies and loans.

Just before I leave, the orientation committee has been decorating the board for the talent night. the design looked really cool, for one thing, and I have been eavesdropping while they are chatting away. I know it&apos;s bad, but complains about one of the Student Affair Department officer is really hard to resist. Yeah for knowing that I&apos;m not the only one thinking that she&apos;s a double-faced witch.

School starts next week, with six subjects to boot. Hopefully it&apos;ll be a better semester. So there! My… I&apos;m still feeling warm and fuzzy deep down even though the air conditioner is killing me. Felix&apos;s signing off now ;).
