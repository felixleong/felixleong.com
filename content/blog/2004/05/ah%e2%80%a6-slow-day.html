Ah… total relaxation. That&apos;s really something. Everything is so slow around here that I can almost feel that my unproductiveness started to sink in. But that aside, I have been listening to SEB110 again, and I&apos;m glad to say that I&apos;m extremely happy with it. Heck! It might be the best non-stop mix that I heard so far! The first disc somewhat sets the mood for old Eurobeat nostalgia while pumping in some excitement while B4 Za Beat (Umm… I hope that I didn&apos;t mix B4 Za Beat with Y&Co., since I don&apos;t have my CD with me now) slowly leads us along the old days of Eurobeat. Then while it progresses, they show off of their best remixing skills and pumping in more excitement and more upbeat tunes. And I really wanted for more when they ended it with "We&apos;ll be right back after this word!"

Then goes the second disc, and wow! That&apos;s a roller coaster ride prepared by Y&Co. (again, if I mixed up, sorry :p) gang! Almost every single song chosen have a really strong punch and aggressiveness that glue you to the seats. And that&apos;s not all, they do have some really interesting transitions and effects up in their sleeves and pulls out endless surprises while they mixed the whole thing together. Check out My Sweet Banana in this CD to see what I meant.

The 3rd disc isn&apos;t too exciting, but being a Ayumi and MAX fan myself, I&apos;m really glad that the CD is packed with some good songs in non-stop format (Basically it&apos;s two non-stop remixes in one CD: One for Ayu-ro and the other for MAX EURO).

The verdict: A perfect 10/10! Possibly the best non-stop remix Eurobeat CD that you can possibly own (Umm… of course, I haven&apos;t heard most of them, but I would say that it&apos;s by far the best from all my non-stop Eurobeat CDs that I have own) You won&apos;t regret getting this babe, trust me ;). (It&apos;s even better than SEB120, IMHO)

Other than that…
1. My mom just gave me a hair cut, which is fine. But it is so short that my hair looks thin XD. It&apos;s OK though, since I didn&apos;t look bad with it :3.
2. I only noticed that the antenna of my new handphone I got (Sony Ericsson T100) isn&apos;t strong enough that it gave me really disappointing reception. So sending messages to my friends is a real pain in the neck. But then, I do suspect that the operator is at fault though, since the signal of other providers are really strong. Hmm… I suspect that I might have more disappointment soon, but the features and stuff in the phone is really satisfying though.
3. GOSH! I&apos;m procrastinating again! Let see… some pixel art, some data to be cleaned for our research project, our homepage needs some updating… Umm… ._." Guess I have to give my lazy bones a work out.

Guess that&apos;s it. Hmm… maybe I should call my friends up later :p.
