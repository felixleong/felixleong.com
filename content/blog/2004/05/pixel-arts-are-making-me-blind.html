Gosh! I&apos;m still working on artworks to be included in my portfolio… And doing everything in pixel level is killing my eyes. Anyway, here&apos;s some updated screen:

This is version 1.5 of the artwork… I like how I did the clouds, too bad I used too much colours.

This is version 2, with LOTS of shading (thanks for the critique by Sherman). I&apos;m not totally impressed with the clouds… looks like version 2.5 should be around the corner.

Need to work on animated sprites soon before I might lose the chance for the job!
