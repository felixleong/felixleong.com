Wellâ€¦ I&apos;m pretty bored here (well, not really, I really need to think ideas to fill in my portfolio). But anyway, auctions sites has always gave me a reason to drool (in a heartaching way though).

I&apos;m currently eying on a lot of CDs which I wanted (including the only ayu-ro disk (the first one) which I need to complete my ayu-ro collection and there&apos;s *two* of them over eBay). Argh! x.x"

I guess I must stay away from Yahoo! Auction Japan and eBay for quite some time.

Doing a search in CDJapan, Maharaja HI-NRG Night Vol. 9 which contains Don&apos;t You Love Me by Virginelle is out of print ;_;.
