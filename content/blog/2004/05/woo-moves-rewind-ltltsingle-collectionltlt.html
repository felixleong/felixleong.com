Guess what I found in the CD shop today ^^! move&apos;s REWIND &lt;&lt;single collection+&lt;&lt;, and what&apos;s sweeter is that it&apos;s the first pressing limited edition disc set together with a DVD with their PVs &lt;3. Imagine the internal struggle that I go through because I have been spending way too much on CDs lately ^^". But I got the CD and it&apos;s MIIIINE XD.

Here&apos;s the CD cover ;) (with the booklet on your right):

(Ignore the green, PG sticker by the Singapore&apos;s censorship board XD)

Anyway, I&apos;m just wondering:
- What music genre should move&apos;s music be categorized into? I believe that it&apos;s not J-Pop all right &lt;.&lt;. Anyone can help? (prods Dom)
- Who&apos;s the model in the covers anyway! XD I remember that usually move always appeared in most of their album covers, and this time it seems like it&apos;s a model with some fake, wooly hair instead. Hmmâ€¦

Damn! I wish for a DVD player ;_;. (Guess I have to make an appointment with someone who has it :p)

School starts tomorrow, and I hope for a great start this semester ^^.
