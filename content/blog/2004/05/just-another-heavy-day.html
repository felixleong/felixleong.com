{% mark post -%}A few things happened today, not completely happy ones, but somewhat I didn&apos;t feel bad or anything. Despite the brief emotional turbulence inside, I just feel a sense of determination and calm.

Earlier this morning, I managed to get Allen on the line. I chatted with him for a while, well… eventually he told me that I shouldn&apos;t pour out too much feelings to him, and later confessed that he had someone else. Crushed? Yes. But somehow this time I&apos;m able to shift my gears down as per request, and I just feel much more prepared to accept the facts. It&apos;s not all impossible though, he said that it&apos;s better to decide until we meet. There&apos;s a possibility that the special feeling might fade and slip away from me, but one thing for sure is that he&apos;s still one really special friend that I have. For now, I would just like to sit back, and see how things will turn out. :)

Then later at night, my aunt brought me to the fortune teller. When I stepped into the house, I&apos;m fascinated by all those paintings and sculptures of Buddha and three big fish tanks with goldfish, carp and another type of pet fish which I can&apos;t recall it&apos;s name. (Hmm… anyone knows the name of a red fish that kisses each other?) Then I saw the master and his wife coming out to greet us, they are really friendly, and the master&apos;s eye seems to look as if they can read your thoughts. Hmm…

Before he starts the consultation, he did some sort of a ceremony of sorts, and all of a sudden his deep voice has magically turned into a more high-pitched, womanly voice. Surprising as it might sound, it is not for us Chinese since there&apos;s a belief that certain psychics are able to summon deities or souls and their character and voice will change accordingly.

When it my turn, my aunt and I slowly seated ourselves, and my aunt started the consultation by mentioning that I was still studying and wondering how I&apos;ll turn out. After that, the master just ask a few questions regarding my current situation, with a tone like he definitely knew something. Then every single thing he told me afterwards has completely strucked me: Me being all stressed out, not because of others, but being piled up by myself. I have been always worrying about other people before myself, especially family and friends… worrying that I disappoint them or didn&apos;t do well enough to help them. And sometimes I get so sensitive that I confuse myself a lot of times and my self confidence took the worst hit. This will be a year of confusion this year, he said. After that, he gave me a pat on the shoulder, telling me that I&apos;m a good boy and I&apos;ve doing great all along. As much as I have heard these words from many people, including the people who are close to me, I never heard them being so assuring and comforting before. I can&apos;t stop but feeling touched… so touched that I broke down, and I can&apos;t believe that these assuring words have to come from a total stranger. Guess the best advice I got from him is that live your own life, do whatever you feel right. Don&apos;t care how others might think about you, as long you know that you can doing the right thing and face yourself with confidence.

Now… I&apos;m at home now, feeling tired, yet content with what I had now. I knew there&apos;s a lot of doubt and troubles yet to be get rid of, but somewhat I feel a little bit more confident to confront them now.{%- endmark %}
