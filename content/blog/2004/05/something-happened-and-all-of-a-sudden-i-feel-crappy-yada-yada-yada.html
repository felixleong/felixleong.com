Summary: I hate losing, and I really do, no matter how small and temporary that thing is.

Longer Story: Well, apparently someone spotted some original copies of SEB and another friend of mine is going to snatch them all ;_;. And I DON&apos;T want to skip classes or waste any money because of that. But I still hate the prospect of losing.

Anyway, I&apos;m just getting so disappointed that I do feel crappy now. Guess I&apos;ll head for bed soon to sleep it off. Besides, there&apos;s always CDJapan. (albeit being expensive due to currency exchange rate and shipping) So I&apos;m not that worried.

Now that does makes me more nervous and anxious in waiting for my parcel from Dom ;_;.
