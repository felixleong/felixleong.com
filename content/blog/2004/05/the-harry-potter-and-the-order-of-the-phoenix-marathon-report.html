Phew! What a feat! Finally I finished reading the 700+ pages Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix! What a read!

Anyway, it wasn&apos;t really an engrossing read compared to the first four, maybe it&apos;s partially because that the suspense factor isn&apos;t that strong any more.By that, I personally believe that Rowling has definitely took a different take in terms of storyline. In the previous four, the storyline much more follows the adventures that Harry and friends are having, there&apos;s always the interesting "who&apos;s-the-culprit" detective style endings with really interesting twists.

But having Lord Voldemort being back into power in The Goblet of Fire (4th book), it&apos;s pretty much understandable why Rowling took a different turn in unfolding Harry&apos;s fifth year in Hogwarts. From what I read it, now the focus has shifted from Harry&apos;s adventures to Harry himself. Now, as Harry has grown to be a teenager, she vividly put more focus in describing his feelings and emotions, and the typical "teenage rebellion" of his, which pretty much gives a twist to the innocent yet brave image he used to have in the past. He&apos;s not the same Harry Potter that we used to know now, he had certainly grown up, and empathy (or maybe sympathy would be a better word?) being build up looking at how his fears grow, his cherry perceptions of things being shattered… and how deep the past have been affecting him.

Of course, Rowling had really expanded the wizardry world now, with the Ministry of Magic being on the spotlight now. Of course, being hinted in the The Goblet of Fire, she had pretty much unveil the dark side of the wizard world behind the bright exterior. Read: Politics. Yes, this time, Voldemort didn&apos;t take a lot of limelight to show its wrath in the wizard world, which I think is the biggest suspense turn-off in this book. But then again, thinking about it, Voldemort will have his chances (a big one in fact, with spotlights as bright as the sun) in the last two books anyway, so why not a change and have fun with politics then?

And yeah, the most hated part when I read the book is not about the book itself, but the stupid morons who doesn&apos;t know what a spoiler is. Yes, I was being spoilt with Sirius death. But then, his death didn&apos;t gave me any big emotional impact. Really, it doesn&apos;t. Well, in the fourth book, I squirm in my seat when I read Cedric&apos;s murder (by the Dark Lord), and felt about it, as much Cedric didn&apos;t play a big role in the series. But this time… I felt nothing for Sirius death… Nothing at all. I wonder that whether is it that I&apos;m spoilt by the fact (but then, I cried for Aeries in FF7 even though I&apos;m spoilt!), or the death should be more dramatic than this? Hmm… I suppose Rowling has her plans regarding Sirius in the next two books? But to be fair, I felt sorry for Harry, just not sorry enough to make me cry.

To wrap this up, as much as the latest book in the series can be read light-heartedly, the essence only shines if it&apos;s being treated in a much more serious manner. It&apos;s already not the same Harry Potter we used to know any more, partially due to the fact that Harry grew and Rowling does seem to put in more effort to accommodate the adult readers. But the latest instalment still lives up to it&apos;s name (as much as I would like to complain that it&apos;s not engrossing enough and I&apos;m being spoilt), and I certainly can&apos;t wait when Harry enters his sixth and final year. Yes, it might not be all that engrossing, but think about it, it does seem that this book serves as a really strong foundation for the next two books. So Rowling better exploit that and bring it to new heights!

Well… spending about 24 hours reading the book, it&apos;s exhausting, and I ended up waking up at 1 in the afternoon today. XD But then, I think I would really read it the second time round, to pick up details which I missed in the first reading.

In other news, I tried a lemon flavoured soft drink today. Talk about carbonated lemonade XD.
