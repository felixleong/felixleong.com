{% mark post -%}Well… I&apos;m back. Somewhat I felt really reluctant to go back, but I have to.

Before my aunt drives us back to KL, she went to visit a friend of her, who is a doctor. During their conversation, I heard quite a bit about my deceased uncle and some untold stories about my family. Somewhat I do feel ashamed now, for not knowing anything regarding my family and relatives. I never knew a lot of my uncles and aunts, or my parents even, But today, I get to indulge part of those interesting facts and stories about them.

In other news, I&apos;m near to getting the pixel artist job. I just need to send a few more samples and if they liked it, I&apos;m going to be hired! <3 The boss said that my sample are utter crap though, cause it&apos;s… girlish XD. But I suppose that&apos;s what I do best XD.

Other than that… I&apos;m tired. :p{%- endmark %}
