{% mark post -%}The Malaysian Badminton team went packing today in Jakarta when they lost to Indonesia in Thomas Cup quarter-finals. Well… it&apos;s pretty much expected, but the second doubles did put up a good show, as much they did irritate me initially when they make tons of mistakes.

As for me… I&apos;m still bored.
