Just came back from Penang, but as much as I was really expected to post a really exciting account on what happened during the past three days. But just when I&apos;m on my way home, I was being robbed! It&apos;s no biggie actually, they only stole my cash (which is of a small amount) and my handphone. I should have trust my instincts and my knowledge that the route I&apos;m taking is dark and quite deserted, yet I&apos;m so in a hurry that I totally forget about my tiny inner voice.

Just after that, I&apos;m in total panic that I forgot to lodge at least a police report and head straight back home (thanks [at least I can get home] or no thanks [for not doing what I should do: i.e. calling for help] to the fact that I still had my prepaid travel card). I&apos;m safe now, but now I&apos;m feeling really down.

I don&apos;t know… really. I&apos;ve told my parents about it and they are glad that I&apos;m unhurt and unscratched. …Guess I&apos;ll leave the exciting stuff when I got my spirits back up. Take care you all! (And don&apos;t try to walk in deserted areas without someone with ya!)
