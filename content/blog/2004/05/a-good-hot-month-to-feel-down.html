Great…. hot weather, sinking heart. How great was that? What&apos;s worse, it rains heavily lately and it seems like it&apos;s going to rain sometime soon, which doesn&apos;t look too good, which also means that I might get stuck somewhere later.

Want anything worse? My mind seems to go haywire lately, or should I say that it doesn&apos;t work as it should? Or maybe I just feel like not clicking with anyone whom I talk to today? It&apos;s not a good sign, I would say.

Well… hope this ends soon… REALLY soon. I suppose May isn&apos;t a good month? I wonder whether it had to do with Venus though :p.

What makes it even interesting when I queried this in Google:

Hmm… coincidence? But I suppose it&apos;s only me with shallow understanding towards astrology :p.

[p/s: Maybe it&apos;s just me, but I can&apos;t stop feeling a little bit worried with Ahmed… >.>… Hope he&apos;s going to be all right]
