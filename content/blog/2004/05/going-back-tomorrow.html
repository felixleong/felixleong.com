Well… I&apos;m going back to KL tomorrow to stay with my aunt. So today will be my last day with my family for this semester break. The heat is still unbearable and I got extremely exhausted the whole day (due to lack of sleep) and cranky (well… stupid weather). Other than that, it&apos;s just another peaceful day.

My parent make some chicken soup today, and I&apos;ll be having it a while later. But I&apos;m sure that the taste will be the same as how I remembered it. Well, everything at home is always something to remember and full with nostalgia. When my mom mentioned that she&apos;s thinking of renovating the house… I just feel a gush of emotions coming up to me. Guess I&apos;m going to miss how my house looks like if that happens, cause every item in the house almost have a story beneath their old looks.

For some reasons, I do feel a bit vulnerable, to a point that it really sounds crazy. Well, I just feel like one of the those single guys who is desperately wants to be married. Of course, the idea of marriage didn&apos;t cross my head, but the desire for some romance does expand to a point that I have been having really wild imagination, and that does amplify the vulnerable feeling I had in the past.

And yeah, I&apos;m starting to miss my ex-crush again. Ah well. :p
