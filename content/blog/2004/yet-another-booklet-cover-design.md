Somehow I do need to think of a way to scream my lungs out because I didn't sleep proper today just to get one design done for the *ugh* Student Affairs Department (codename: SAD).

They better don't ignite my anger and fury.

I experimented with a new colouring style for this one, and it turns out to be quite cool indeed :). Yet another proud artwork from me ^^b.
