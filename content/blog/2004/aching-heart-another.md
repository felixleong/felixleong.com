Today I just received another message from my ex-crush asking me out for supper… and I just staring at my cell… and replied to him that I'm going to be free afterwards. As much as I already knew he's going to talk about some Internet business that I don't think I'll be interested in, my aching heart just don't allow to say no in meeting him…

Slouching on my chair facing the monitor, the screen is reflecting my teary eyes… a sight that I don't really want to see… miserable… still clinging on a fantasy that won't realise… How many times that I tell myself that I have to be strong? How many times that I had tried to let the feeling go? How many times that I had tried to hold my tears…?

However… the longer I hold back my desire of loving him, the more that my desire to be loved by someone special grows. As much I have accepted the fact and believed that I'll be able to find another love, my subconscious mind always connects the word "love" with him without much thought. As much as I have decided to move forward, I can't stop but turning my head to the past… and reopen the Pandora's box all over again?

How many times have I hugged a pillow for a sense of being loved and security? How many times I have met with interesting people but holding back because of the haunting pain? How many times that I have experienced the strong desire of being loved by someone… to a point that it hurts?

I guess I'll get better as soon as my tears dry up and I'll be able to move on with my life… yet I just don't know when will this nagging and sad feeling will stop and reincarnate into a strong positive energy… Does anyone know when will that be? Maybe by the time I'm able to get over it? How long would that be?…

In other news, my Flash assignment is almost done despite of some nasty Windows crashes. Hopefully it'll be done by tomorrow and I'll be able to shift my attention to my other assignments. And as for tonight, I guess I'll just listen to some sales pitch, say no, and get over with it… at least with his "Internet business" thingy.

May all of you reading this be showered with love.
