Guess what I got in the mail today?

SQUEEEEEEE~~~~~!!!

OK, I definitely <333 PPP6's tracklist, especially the solos (Liked Too Young To Fall In Love ever since I got my SEB100). Haven't watched PPP7 yet, but I'll be doing so after I got my online stuff done. PPP5 is a bit of a disappointment, but most probably is that I didn't like most of the songsâ€¦ yet. But then again PPP5 SP is darn cool!

Anyway, gotta rush back to watch more vids <333.
