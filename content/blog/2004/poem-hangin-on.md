It's a dark and rainy morning today, well… not a good sign when you have to walk to school. Anyway, creativity just struck and I drafted this one. This might not of any real poetic value (well… I personally didn't like it that much), but I suppose I just post up to share:

### Hangin' On

"Hang on there!"  
I hear your whispers around me  
Slowly I opened my weary eyes  
Seeing nothing but my own illusions…

I have been clinging on this cliff… helpless  
So long that my past is fading away from me  
I have been trying to recall  
those fading memories when I was small  
The time when I believed in dreams…

"Hang on there"  
I hear your whispers around me again  
I knew it wasn't real  
Yet I'm still looking around  
But what I see is only dark skies  
and there's no clouds that looked like you

"Hang on there…"  
 … your whispers are getting softer  
"… hang on there…"  
 … I'm starting to notice  
 that I'm hanging on to this hopeless cliff for too long…

"<span style="font-size: 60%">… hang on there…</span>"  
 … I'm starting to remember the past…  
 … Up till we went separate ways…

"…"  
"NO! HANG ON THERE!"  
The cries filled the gloomy skies  
I just don't want to lose your voice!  
… Arms trembling  
… I'm starting to lose my grip…  
Please… Let me continue with my journey…  
I don't want to miss you one last time…

…  
…  
"… <span style="font-size: 60%">Hang on there</span>…"
