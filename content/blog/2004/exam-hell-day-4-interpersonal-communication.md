Ah~ I screwed another A this time. I wasted too much time on one section, which ends up having myself not having enough time to finish my paper.

But overall I believe that I did well, just hope that's enough to cover up my failure of planning.

Anyway, next up is Advanced Artificial Intelligence on the 13th. I think I really need to put in more effort to raise the bar this time.

In other news, Steven, Choon Hui, Sue Ching and I went for lunch today. THe conversations and jokes on over there is really funny :p, too bad I really don't understand Hokkien (a Chinese dialect) well. And I just feel a little bit disappointed in some ways… I don't know, just felt that Choon Hui is kinda quiet than he is used to. He said that he's a bit tired due to the long hours of studies (awww… :( ). Hope he feels better later.

For some reasons I just feel a little bit… well, unloved today. I don't know, I think I better go outside and have some fun to replenish that love source. I really hate to become too sticky to Choon Hui… I know he doesn't like that. But then again, I really wished that we can be a little bit closer, as close friends or something… ARGH~ I have been putting myself in some unwanted dilemma again.

On an unrelated note, eBay has really pumped in more competition in snatching SEB CDs. And damn you Kam for outbidding me in some CDs I wanted XDDD *nudge Ahmed*. It's a good thing though, I think I have bid too much CDs there :p. Just won SEB51, if that's any consolation (but then again, that's not my most wanted CD… AH~ Whatever).
