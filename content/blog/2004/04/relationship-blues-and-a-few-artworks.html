Yesterday night was really a heart-throbbing experience… It&apos;s nothing really, just the "Allen obsessive-compulsive syndrome" ^^". As much as I know that it happens (especially considering the fact this was my first time)… well, my brain can&apos;t seem to erase the fact that he&apos;ll always be there and kept on screaming "I CAN&apos;T GET ENOUGH OF HIM!!!" *sigh* Guess I need some time to cool down a bit. My heartbeat rate seems to increase by a factor of <i>x</i> the whole day, possibly excited. Well… it was painfully… sweet.

And yeah, I spent the whole night drawing stuff for my pen-pal, who is involve in their manga group called Crazy Catz, and here&apos;s what I came out with:

<a href="http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/artwork/sheoresmall.png">Sheore (coloured)</a>

The inked one took me quite a long time, and after inking I did notice some major boo-boos (Argh! Stupid crossing arms in the wrong position) and the hatching can be better. And the colour pencilled one is pretty much rushed. But anyway… did spent me about 6~10 hours completing them both, hope you enjoy it!

What else, oh! Today should be the time when I should start my readings *groan*. But I think I&apos;ll pop-up in Time Square to join our Parapara gathering for a few hours.Dom has went to Japan, hope she has a good time! ;) And I halfway into adding new CDs into my collection, heh heh… (um… just hope everything turns well for me :p)
