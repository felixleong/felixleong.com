{% mark post -%}Just received a mail from a local game company, <a href="http://www.sherman3d.com/">Sherman3D</a>, saying that they have an opening for a job, anyway here&apos;s an excerpt from the e-mail I received:

<i>The pixel artist will not be employed by Sherman3D but will be contracted by 5th Cell (www.5thcell.com) directly. Payment will be negotiated by them but the job will be based in Sherman3D&apos;s office in SunwayMas.

The job will begin in June and it will be a six months contract and should be renewed after that if 5th Cell does well (which it should in my opinion). Also, in June, Joseph Tringali from 5th Cell will be coming down from the US to personally supervise the J2ME programmer and also the pixel artist they are hiring until September. By then, he will pick one to be the local project leader for 5th Cell. Sherman3D will then keep an eye on them but will not be directly involved with management.</i>

So basically there&apos;s two jobs being offered here: Game programmer for mobile phone, and a pixel artist (you know, drawing stuff on pixel level?). Hmm… and I&apos;m still studying right now XD. Sounds like a sweet dream come true to me ^-^… I wonder whether I should take it? Because if I&apos;m going to do it part-time, I&apos;m not going to have free time anymore. XD But then again, they might not hire me in the first place.

Perhaps I&apos;ll just compile a portfolio and resume and decide later whether I wanted to send it out. But first off… exams!{%- endmark %}
