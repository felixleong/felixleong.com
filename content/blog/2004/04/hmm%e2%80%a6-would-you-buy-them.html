Just finished two pixel arts to be included in my portfolio for the pixel artist job, I tried to make some mock game screens:

<a href="http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/portfolio/ingame.png">Star Trip: In Game Screen</a>

Hmm… if they are an actual game, would you buy it? XD (Notice that the screen is vertical, since I&apos;m applying for the pixel artist job for a mobile phone game company)

In other news, in my time zone today, khaki_29uk is celebrating his birthday. Happy birthday!!! *throws confetti and pop some party poppers*
