AIIEEE…!!! Why there&apos;s always hotheaded freaks on the boards who just like to ignite flames for the tiniest details? Gah! Is it that Malaysian always produce bad boardies. Great….

Anyway… Good news: My loans has been cashed into my bank account. One of my best friend from my hometown ask me for supper just now and we had a great time chatting nonsense. That was fun!

Currently I&apos;m fixing up a really messy board. Stupid jerks!
