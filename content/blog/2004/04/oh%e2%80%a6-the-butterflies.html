As much there&apos;s one more assignment due this Saturday, I don&apos;t really feel that productive… instead of reading up some research materials, I have been lying on my bed, loading Trillian&apos;s message history and savour some of the conversations that I had with some of my message board friends. It&apos;s really nostalgic, reading kinds words (and corrections to my English) from maryadavies, the wackiness from Phil, deep and interesting thoughts from Ahmed… I can&apos;t stop but smiled while reading them through carefully, occasionally laughing some of the misunderstanding and confusion that we had together, understanding some parts of the previous conversion which doesn&apos;t seem to make sense… It&apos;s just fun.

But on the other hand, I have been experiencing the butterflies… something that I haven&apos;t really experienced for a long time. I&apos;m starting to notice a pattern that I&apos;m starting to miss a few of my online buddies (yup, it&apos;s plural all right), even though we have chatted just only a few days or even a few hours ago. You know, the kind of feeling which you feel like someone is between friends and love? As much we have been truthful to each other and admit the kind of attraction to the other, the feeling is much more intense than what we had previously said during the chat session. Is it that this kind of online friendship/relationship fulfils my current emotional gaps and desires? Or is it a genuine interest towards each other?

As much as I believe that love knows no boundaries, however I&apos;m think I&apos;m still a bit sceptical especially when it comes to long distance relationship… and maybe gay relationship even. Maybe I still believe that the current social barriers is still large and it takes a lot of effort to get through it. But still… I don&apos;t really understand it myself really, I just have a mixed feeling of love and confusion… as much as I had said to them that I just want to be close friends and have time to understand each other.

Or perhaps I&apos;m getting the addiction? Maybe I should consider plugging off from IM from a while… But… Duh! I&apos;m getting indecisive again
