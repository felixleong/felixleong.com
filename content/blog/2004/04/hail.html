It&apos;s been quite a while I last seen hail happening, the last I believe is about 7~8 years ago when I was still in high school. Today I have the opportunity to witness hail hitting on the floors outdoor, which is only as big as beans and it didn&apos;t last long, but the thunder sound so close that it&apos;s really frightening, and the winds and rain are so strong that rain pours down like a veil/curtain which goes in a near horizontal manner, sometimes swirling around like having a tornado formed by water. It&apos;s quite a sight, as much as it is quite scary.

Now the storm has pretty much subdued, but the rain has yet to cease. Well… at least I can have my notebook running now, life without game music MIDI  can be pretty dull (especially when your CD collection is starting to show signs of being overplayed). Anyway… two more subjects to go and my exam burden will be close to being removed.
