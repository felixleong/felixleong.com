Well… yesterday is quite good, I managed to do my discrete mathematics paper well, if I can manage to get them right, my marks will add into the marks that I have lost during my previous tests. Quite a relieve, I would say. Hopefully that&apos;s enough to boost my CGPA.

Umm… I&apos;m still waiting for my dot matrix to print out my material… sheesh that&apos;s slow. That makes me want a laser printer soon :(… Anyway, tomorrow&apos;s war is on 9. Hope for the best.
