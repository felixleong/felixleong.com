Guess what! My world is starting to glow in pink (although pink is least favourite colour, yeesh… :p). Yup, I&apos;m glad to say that I&apos;m now in a relationship with Allen… well… at least online. As much as we don&apos;t believe it&apos;ll last long (well… if it does then that would be an added bonus) and I personally believe that someone within physical distance will fill the gaps of both of us, I just hope that it&apos;ll last as long as it can last and leave some sweet memories that we&apos;ll cherish for a lifetime. (hopefully only a little pain will be involved during the transition, as much I really, REALLY doubt it. I&apos;ll try my best though, but of course, if he&apos;s "the one" [cough, no Matrix jokes please], then I&apos;m really damn lucky)

Yes! First ever bi-directional relationship for me (after some painful crushes), and first ever crush for Allen. ^-^ v Sweet!

In other news, my study leave officially starts from today, which means that I had only about a week to do all my reading and prepare for my finals. I&apos;m pretty much very ill prepared for this semester, so guess this week will be a totally busy week. As much as I would like to start early, I guess I just give myself a good break out of the recent emotional roller coaster ride and keep everything in balance before I go into full force. Let&apos;s go! Hopefully I can manage to raise my CGPA this time round… umm, as much as my current efforts kind of doubt it.

Other than that, it&apos;s still the monsoon season and the rain is getting as worse as ever, I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s a good thing or not. But at least it makes my room a little bit cooler, which is good. But my showers are getting chilling cold that I can&apos;t stand it. Well, you can&apos;t get everything, I suppose. (and the heater takes too long to provide me with a quick warm shower)

Umm… what else. Well, just feeling all warm and comfy right now, despite the chilling wind. Hormones in the works, yum!
