First ever flunk in my life… that&apos;s what I feel right now. Never once I had ever failed a paper (although I do experience a close call during high school). The maths paper today looks easy yet I&apos;m unable to answer it. And even if I passed, a D on my slip wouldn&apos;t look nice either (God! Fail me instead!). And I&apos;m getting all disappointed as soon as the examiner says "Times up!", and I&apos;m really like crying out loud just after I walked out of the hall.

But… no, that didn&apos;t happen. I&apos;m still putting up a "stressed (or maybe disappointed or defeat)-but-everything&apos;s-still-OK" face instead… Is it I&apos;m becoming stronger? Not really, I&apos;m still feeling like crying and finding someone to hug deep inside. As much as I hate it, I&apos;m still holding back my sadness and swallow every single tear as soon as they reach my throat. I can&apos;t really explain… the best way I can really put it is that I don&apos;t really entrust my sad and vulnerable feelings to others. Even though I had a friend staying over here right now, I don&apos;t even feel like pouring out to him (not to mention he&apos;s not that huggable… umm… maybe it&apos;s only me being picky). And as soon as I reach home reassuring that I&apos;ll have some private space to do so, my aunt from my hometown just happens to drop by, with a family of her friend with her. That makes me feel that my sadness are trapped in the middle of nowhere… unable to find some form of escape and ventilation.

Sometimes I just hope that there&apos;s someone whom I can feel really comfortable and totally vulnerable when needed… but most of them are so far away, either physically or emotionally.

In other news, there&apos;s only three more papers and two more days till exam ends. There&apos;s two papers tomorrow: Moral and Ethics and Multimedia Technology. I&apos;m aiming to get an A for my MT paper so that I can patch the loss of other subjects (especially today&apos;s paper). But with the mood I&apos;m in now… Just hope everything goes well…
