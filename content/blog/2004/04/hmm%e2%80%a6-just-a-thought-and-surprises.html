It&apos;s funny that Chinese does have a tendency to say that a song is about a sad story when they doesn&apos;t understand the lyrics (Is Ayumi&apos;s Voyage sad? Umm… Maybe not). Does makes me wonder…

Other than that, I&apos;m going to a collab with Nine! Woo oo ooo~ Can&apos;t wait to see how it turns out. :3 And then, Tommy (in MYPPF) is tempting me with surprises so that I can forget about my homework and go to the gathering instead… As much as I don&apos;t really feel like it (since I need to finish some assignments), my heart is still tickling to know what that was. Till then, I&apos;m facing a radiation source doing Powerpoints. There :p
