Phew! After an hour of CSS tweaking, I&apos;m glad to announce that my journal is officially blue again! (*note: If you didn&apos;t noticed, I changed my layout yesterday, and the default colour is more like a pastel yellow)

Anyway, I have retained the simplicity of the layout, so it&apos;s pretty much non fancy, but it&apos;s much more elegant than the previous default LJ layout (Yup, I&apos;m lazy, so shoot me :p). I think I&apos;ll make this layout final, I don&apos;t really think I would want to spend time on tweaking my layout all over again. It should look nice with new generation 6 browsers, possibly generation 5 as well. Anyway, just enjoy the view!

Anyway, the news:
- Tomorrow at 2pm will be my first subject of my exams doom, we&apos;ll be having an exams on operating systems and I have less than 24 hours to do my catch up. Wish me luck! (Remind me of the Yahoo ads shouting that AXN is showing 24: Season 2. I liked season 1 of it, but I don&apos;t have time to watch the latest one ;_;)
- Just to play safe, my friend will be staying over during the exam week. Which is good news since my biological alarm clock is bound to fail almost everyday (9am is pretty much mission impossible unless I got bored to death the previous night). The only problem I had with him now is that he has a really nasty tendency to be REALLY noisy and cuss words (especially the "F" word) has became his greetings to his male friends. Geez… Just hope my tolerance level is high enough…

Other than that, I&apos;m getting kinda stressed out right now, and I&apos;m foreseeing that my CGPA will face a new low (since my preparations sucks -_-") Just wish me luck then!
