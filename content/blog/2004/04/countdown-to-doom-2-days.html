Yup… exams are closing in such a wild pace that I&apos;m almost totally unprepared for it o_o". I can feel it breathing over my shoulder, and even worse: I&apos;m KNOW that I&apos;m totally unprepared yet I&apos;m STILL NOT FEELING NERVOUS OR ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE ME READ!!! Augh! So far so good for my self-discipline…

Anyway, been on the computer today, my dialup need to topup today yet the online banking service is temporarily down. Grr… How annoying. Well… since I still have enough funds in my Internet account to allow me to surf for another 2 hours or so, I guess I can wait for a while. But damn! I just hate going to the mall and pay bills! (in case I&apos;m using up the prepaid value in my account before I&apos;m able to pay it online)

Out of the blue I have been watching Ahmed&apos;s Randomness @ Kam&apos;s video… a lot. I don&apos;t know, They are just a bunch of antics, it&apos;s just fun sitting and watching them having fun. (*cough* I wonder whether Ahmed ever play Kirby before, the beginning of it just reminds me of Kirby XD) And for some reasons… it&apos;s just… heartwarming, something genuine that I can&apos;t seem to explain. Maybe I&apos;m just feeling a little jealous over here :p.

In other news, it&apos;s kind of fun seeing some good boardies came back and show up on <a href="http://board.rpgamer.com/">RPGamer</a>, the Misc. section is still getting pretty slow and spam is still there (although it has decreased by a large margin lately)… Just looking forward for some new stuff there. ^-^ (speaking of which, I can&apos;t believe I&apos;m slacking on making tutorials on Fanart! Gah! I guess I can put in some time and effort once my exams end)

[:: Random Stuff ::]
New sig! I combined three different styles in one this time: Anime (the image), abstract (the background) and pixel art (my name) into one. Looks a bit strange, but I kind of liked it :p.
