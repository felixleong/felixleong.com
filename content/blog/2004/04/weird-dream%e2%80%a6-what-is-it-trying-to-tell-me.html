This is the starting of the holiday week, where productivity can go a downward slide without any sort of control, it&apos;s just a good week to be unproductive and doing absolutely nothing.

But no… I have to change my own bedsheets and do some household chores… eeek, not fun work, but I have to do it because it has been quite some time I haven&apos;t cleaned my room, ever since my exam doom started. So there I go, slipping those bedsheets under the mattress, fluffing some pillows. I&apos;m not too sure whether my aunt would want to wash the curtains, so I took them down. After all those work, I&apos;m so tired that I fell on the freshly made bed.

Then I had a weird dream, I can&apos;t remember the beginning of it, but just before I gain consciousness, I dreamt myself in some sort of adventure attire on an antartic country, then I saw myself, sliding myself in a hole almost as big as my side, and I slide myself in, and have a slide in the tunnel (Imagine one of those water slides in a water theme park? Yeah, it feels something like that). Then as deep as I went in, everywhere around me looks darker and darker, and I&apos;m losing momentum gradually came to a halt before I got to the other side of the tunnel. Soon after that I realize I have to crawl myself inside the somewhat snow-filled tunnel… then some sort of fear just haunts me: fear that I&apos;m unable to come out, fear that the entrance will be closed by snow if I turned back, regrets that I didn&apos;t bring a dog with me whatsoever… I&apos;m so scared that I remembered every single detail as soon as I woke up.

Trying to catch my breath, I look on my watch, it&apos;s about 4pm… and I&apos;m starting to feel so tired that I don&apos;t want to wake up. But I gently push myself up so that I can continue with my work. Then I peeked out my room, the curtains are just outside, which supposed to be in the place where the washing machines are. Great! Guess I heard my aunt wrong… now I have to put the curtains back up! And I don&apos;t really feel like it because my room looks cleaner and brighter without them. Ah well… Guess I&apos;ll procrastinate that.
