Great…. hot weather, sinking heart. How great was that? What's worse, it rains heavily lately and it seems like it's going to rain sometime soon, which doesn't look too good, which also means that I might get stuck somewhere later.

Want anything worse? My mind seems to go haywire lately, or should I say that it doesn't work as it should? Or maybe I just feel like not clicking with anyone whom I talk to today? It's not a good sign, I would say.

Well… hope this ends soon… REALLY soon. I suppose May isn't a good month? I wonder whether it had to do with Venus though :p.

What makes it even interesting when I queried this in Google:

[What is Venus in Astrology?](http://www.astrologyzine.com/what-is-venus-in-astrology.shtml)

Hmm… coincidence? But I suppose it's only me with shallow understanding towards astrology :p.

[p/s: Maybe it's just me, but I can't stop feeling a little bit worried with Ahmed… >.>… Hope he's going to be all right]
