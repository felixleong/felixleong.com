*"When you enter a room where no one is there, are you more willing to believe that you're the first one there… or you're alone…?"*

Just happens this morning that I was going through my usual routine: wake up, do my chores, walk to the bus station then taking the bus to school.

During my journey to school, there some guy is ringing the bell, signaling the bus to stop there. At this point, the bus is on a slope going down, where the bus stop is just at the end of the slope. While I was thinking that they just being a little bit early in timing. They kept on ringing the bell, again and again, persisting that they wanted to stop in the middle of it. Later on, the bus driver just stop the bus and let them drop off in the middle of the slope, where there's an obvious scorn on the face of the bus driver.

In some way, that really pissed me off somewhat: It's a slope, goddammit! I don't really care whether the bus manage to brake or not, since it's going down anyway, but what happens if the car at the back couldn't? That's really inconsiderate!

However, as furious as I was, that really sparked a thought somewhat: Aren't we sometimes like that? You know, trying to persist on something that would benefit ourselves and might harm others. As much I understand that sometimes it doesn't hurt to ask, but sometimes, were we considerate when we ask for something?

And the second part of the question: Does the little benefits/convenience really mattered in the end? Really, come to think of it, like the previous scenario, if they weren't in a rush or something, they wouldn't have mind walking the way up (or at least they SHOULDN'T have mind) to where they wanted to go.

But then again, there's just way too many parameters to this question itself: the willingness of the person being asked to grant a request (in the previous scenario, it seemed that the request is only granted because it's annoying), the environment a request is being made (in the previous scenario, the stretch of road isn't too busy yet), the power of both parties…

Hmm… Maybe I just think too much, and does it really mattered? Well… at least I believe it mattered to be a little bit considerate when someone didn't grant your request :), but keep the persistence ^^.

Anyway, gotta prepare for my Doomtrain-ish presentation, hope I can manage without having it running over me :p.
