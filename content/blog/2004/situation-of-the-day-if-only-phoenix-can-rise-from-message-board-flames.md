title: Situation of The Day: If Only Phoenix Can Rise From Message Board Flames

OK, extending from the last entry: Apparently the two involved in the flame are from the same area (Penang… Duh! And I'm thinking of going there in peace during labours day for a break! >\_<"), and one of them keep shooting the other for his chosen "Penang Pro Paralist" rank (Yup, we had the rank rewarding system over here), causing some commotions and flames on the board.

Before I saw it coming, another administrator got panicked by the sight of it and lock up the thread (Thank god Tommy! Gotta thank you for that). Then when I saw that thread, I was totally in shock to see the flames, guess I have no choice but to clear them up (um… I'm not sure deleting flames is a good idea, RPGamer usually do off with edits and locks and NO deletion), and then I reopen the "clean" thread. I have to send an official warning to the person who started it. I'm not sure whether I'm doing the right thing… But definitely my horoscope for today does rang true, REALLY true:

*A third party will cramp your style today - in fact could even spell disaster. It is up to you.*

Gosh… can anyone tell me whether I did the right thing?

[:: sidenote: I slept as late as 4am yesterday just to clear up the mess, well… at least it's a good time to send some songs to dJeu for my performance mix. Even after I woke up today at 10, I still feeling all anxious and nervous. Crap! Not a really good thing when you need to do exam preparations! Why unexpected things and chaos always have bad timings? ::]
