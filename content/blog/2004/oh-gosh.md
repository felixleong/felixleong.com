Gah! My webcam is spoilt! >.<" Ugh… How am I suppose to film my choreos without a cam! Duh… Well… Looking at the bright side of things, at least I can buy myself a better webcam… but… Augh! That's gonna bang my budget again. Well… guess I can just wait ;\_\_\_;.

Being lovesick again, which is OK until the destructive thoughts starts to flood my brain. That's not fun. Gotta love Lolita's Heart Attack, it always blast my negative thoughts away. (Well, I just can't control it when I hear "You'll be my scrambled eggs" XDDDD) And funny thing is that I suddenly found ideas to choreo the dance (Yeah, I KNOW velfarre have already choreo'd it), and surprisingly 75% went pretty well. :) Downside, my Go Go's and The Monkeys para got screwed up XDDD.

But guess I do have time to refine my dance before I get another webcam.
