The Malaysian Badminton team went packing today in Jakarta when they lost to Indonesia in Thomas Cup quarter-finals. Well… it's pretty much expected, but the second doubles did put up a good show, as much they did irritate me initially when they make tons of mistakes.

As for me… I'm still bored.

Hmm… in other news, I seriously feel like embarking a new journey… or find another love… I suppose. XD
