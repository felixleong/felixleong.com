Hmm… actually this should two entries instead of one, but since I didn't get online to get the older one posted, I guess I just combine them into one. Here goes nothing~

## Around 2 am

Oooh ooh ooh~ just got my performance mix mixed by Michael (dJeu)! :D I'm really excited when it gets patched through into my system, not everything goes well though… while he's halfway in sending it through, I just finished updating my firewall software… and accidentally said Yes when it ask whether I wanted to restart my computer. Noooo~! Then when I want to log back into MSN Messenger, Microsoft seems to pick a right timing to put up a new version of MSN, halting me from getting into MSN **unless** I get the update. Augh! >\_<

Luckily Michael is kind enough to upload it up over a webspace so that I can snag it off from there, thanks a million, Michael! *^0^*

I'm really glad to say that the mix is great, as much as Michael did mentioned that he's not too satisfied the fact that "Palapala Paladise, Welcome to my paladise" (Engrish XD) has somewhat been overused. Hmmm… I dunno, I kinda like it being repeated over several parts of the song, making it sound like a recurring theme (hey! It's about Parapara all right! *^^*).

Dance wise… Hmm… I don't know, maybe it's my drying creative juices, I just find most transition parts can go really nicely with stand still poses, but really, doing that during every single transition will make it VEEEEERY dull. But anyway, I don't think I'll working on that since my exams are much more pressing, besides, I got a week to practice before I go to Penang. I don't know, maybe I'll get it filmed once I got the choreograph done.

Anyway, in other news:
- My game music MIDI collection is going to hit the 3600 mark. And almost all of them are only MIDIs for the RPGs that I had played before. I wonder what happens when I started to collect MIDIs for newer FFs (FF9 and above). Heh…
- Allen in not feeling well physically (gastric) and perhaps emotionally… makes me reallly worried about him. Really hoped that he gets better soon <=(.
- Having two math subjects is really evil. Guess I have to do some exercise right now.
- Tomorrow's going to be the coolest Parapara gathering where we'll be gathering outside the arcades! Wee… Can't wait!

## Now:

Phew! Just came back from the gathering. Umm… no stage XD, since they have moved it elsewhere for some events downstairs, but we just sat in a corner in a mall, got our equipment (pretty much only an extension cord, a compact CD player, a set of cheap computer speakers and of course, Eurobeat CDs!) and just have fun on the corridor.

Yeah, it's pretty fun since it's the first time we bring Para out in public, and passer-bys often gave the "WTF?" kind of look XD. Anyway, have fun with a couple of songs (Heartbeat, and augh! I forgot the routine for Killing My Love). And the speakers are so loud that the hip-hop attire shop have to turn up their volume in attempt to drown our music… but failed XD. Yay to a pair of good speakers which only cost me RM25 (about US$8) XD. Somewhat doing it on the corridor instead of a proper stage made me feel like we're a bunch of bad kids loitering on the mall XD. (Maybe it's true? XD)

On my way back, I have a good conversation with some Mormon missionaries (hmm… *prods maryadavies*. Apparently there's a Latter Day Saints church near my aunt's place, and I have been bumping into a lot of missionaries during the past. It's quite fun talking to them though, although some of them did sound like religion salesperson (umm… no offence, guys, just have that kind of first impression on some). I haven't been to their church though, either my schedule is packed with my stuff, or it just me not really prepared to understand a belief deeply.

Hmmm… maybe I'll just drop by some day later. Anyway, gotta do some math exercise to warm myself up for the exams.

[^1]: For those who didn't know, I'm using Trillian as my main IM program. And apparently Trillian is still bad in file transfers… nothing gets through using Trill. And MSN is **THE** only independent IM that resides in my computer right now, which I only keep it for file transfers. >_>
