I now declare myself inethical for stealing company (that I'm working for)'s bandwidth to download songs from @music which I'll pay later back at home.

Hmm…. XDDDD

Anyway, I'm back at work, still pulling hair out to program encryption stuff for the company. X( Bleh… With all the education/Cryptography classes I have taken (at least last semester), the theory does needs some digesting before I can cough out some practical codes X(.

Anyway, 8 hours more… I hope that I can win that Maharaja HI-NRG Night Vol. 11 from eBay (Gorky Park and Babe Follow Me <3333). *crosses fingers*
