And I remembered that I *used* to hate PB2's TECHNO DRIVE last time. Then all of a sudden, I have picked up a certain liking towards the song. Hmm… I suppose there are some artist which does need some patience to like them? (*cough* Nuage *cough*)

Anyway, I have been strolling at my nearby CD store to check some CDs for my friend. Well… Somewhat I noticed that he started to become such a fanboy to some of the chinese artists these days, notably S.H.E and Jolin. Hmm… I did notice that I'm no where from being better from him considering that I'm *so* into J-Pop (Ayumi Hamasaki and MAX) and Eurobeat lately :p. At the same time, I started to notice PB2's (or Pool Bit Boys) debut album in the bargain bin. Well, I *know* it's there but I gave it a skip when I still hated TECHNO DRIVE. It's time to pick that up and give it a try, I said to myself. Besides, it's only RM9.90! (Less than US$3)

I'm surprised that the CD have the kind of sunny kind of feel, pretty much every song in the album is really upbeat and happy. Hmmm… too bad there's a few rapping tracks which I didn't like that much (I cringe at some… well, what genre do you call hip-hop music?). A pretty decent album, I would say ^^, it can better if they had better tracks at the end and have more songs packed into it. Ah well, guess I'm just picky :p.

In other news, I'm thinking of using my laser printer to earn some extra income by helping others to print out documents, and it seems that my printer can't really rest with me printing lots of ebooks and stuff. Hmm… I wonder whether how much income I can get from there?
