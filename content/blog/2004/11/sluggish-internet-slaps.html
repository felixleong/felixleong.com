{% mark post -%}Gah! For some reasons the Internet is getting REALLY sluggish @_@". Add the fact that I&apos;m on dialup with makes matters 1000 times worse. *Slaps!*

Anyway, I&apos;m planning to get the latest distribution of Inkscape now… ;____;. I don&apos;t wanna wait an hour to get it downloaded ;______;.

Here&apos;s another cover art I have done… honestly… it wasn&apos;t much different from the previous design so most probably I would have dump this away. But I do had fun doing the kerning and letter spacing stuff. So I&apos;m still pretty much experimenting the features in Inkscape. Hopefully I&apos;ll go… somewhere with it XDDD.

In other news, all of a sudden someone emailed saying that he really liked my manga site… which I haven&apos;t been maintaining it like… YEARS? XDDD And currently with Freewebsites.com being "blergh~*, that person offered me some webspace to host my site on :). Pretty cool! ^^b. Hmm… I suppose it doesn&apos;t hurt to give it a try, shouldn&apos;t I? Hmmm….

Oh yeah, I NEARLY forgot, Erika and Steven came to my house, and THANK YOU Steven for all the off-colour jokes *is sarcastic >:p* XDDDD.{%- endmark %}
