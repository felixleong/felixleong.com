{% mark post -%}So… I got some new CDs: hitomi&apos;s thermo plastic &amp; Final Fantasy X-2&apos;s OST :). I break one rule though: Because my principle is that I don&apos;t listen to any game music that I have never played before. But… since it&apos;s hard for me to find game music CDs anyway (stupid Digicube for not exporting game music ;___;, and I SWEAR that I&apos;m not going to buy another bootleg anymore), and so I bought it :3.

Anyway, I haven&apos;t listened to them both yet XDDD. Well… at least not the whole CD :p. Hitomi&apos;s style seems to remind me of the main vocalist in globe (forget the name), but first impression wise… well… I still need some time listening this CD a few more times. But… I really love Koda Kumi&apos;s 1000 Words &lt;333, it&apos;s not the type which will catch your attention instantly, but the more you listen to it… the more it grows in me.

The lyrics… are so beautiful… Here&apos;s a portion of it (mainly the chorus): [And yeah I did the translation from the translated Chinese lyrics card contained in the overseas version of the CD]

<i>"I will come back"

Your voice have passed from me
Voice having the sense of stubbornness
Acting to be strong
If I were to go back in time
Should I be shouting loudly?
Should I be crying to ask you to stay?
If it were to be who I am now, I&apos;ll be able to do it
No matter what it takes

All that I&apos;m unable to voice out
The thousand words
I give it all to you
Your back from afar
Will transform into your wings

All that I&apos;m unable to voice out
The thousand words
I give it all to you
Holding
Your wounded back
Hugging you tight…"</i>

God… I wished that I owned a PS2. Ah well. I didn&apos;t even own a PS as well ;___;. Nu… I wanna play the newer Final Fantasies~ (9 onwards)

Anyway… been drifting my thoughts away with Ahmed and Erika today. I always… feel a bit scared, because most of the people around me wouldn&apos;t want to hear all the long winded stuff… It&apos;s seems like they really don&apos;t like to be dragged into my own never-never land. But somehow… guess my perceptions towards the people around me aren&apos;t entirely accurate… because… it seems that… both Ahmed and Erika listened to all my drifting thoughts, and beared with me during long moments of silence while I collect my own words and thoughts. I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s only today, or is it that all the while I have been terribly mistaken… But… I suppose it has to be the latter, because they are the only people whom I know would listen to me drifting away… in a sea of uncollected thoughts.

And that gave me a chance… to see things much more clearly.

Taking it on a lighter note, I still remembered the time when Ahmed called me a siren XDDD… Well… guess I am, considering what have I done to Erika these few days XDDDD.

Anyway, my relationship status is not THE END by the way, I have to thank Erika for the phone call because I would have drive myself nuts if I were to think too much about the shock I had XD. But… I look at it as a time-out period and revert our status to friends for now, so that it&apos;ll be much more easier to understand each other instead of cracking our heads and figuring out how to work it out (which is… more of a disaster to me XDDD). But yeah, I made a promise with Erika today that I&apos;ll make sure I&apos;ll be happy, I hope she does the same as well :3.

I believe… when the time comes, life will take its own course. And I just hope that things will turn for the better :).

…

AHHHH~~~!!! I&apos;m procrastinating with my alternate cover designs again XDDDD. (Or should I say… I wasted the whole day typing LJ entries XDDDD) Guess less sleep for me today. :p

[p/s: For a portion of the conversation I had with Ahmed, it&apos;s in his journal <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/Ahmed/332762.html#cutid4">here</a>]{%- endmark %}
