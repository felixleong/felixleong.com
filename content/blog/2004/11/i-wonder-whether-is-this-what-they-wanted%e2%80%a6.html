If this is what they wanted (or at least the style they wanted), then my life would be much more easier because this one took me less than 30 minutes to generate it with <a href="http://www.sodipodi.com/">Sodipodi</a> (a open source vector art program, the features are kinda basic, but it&apos;s powerful enough to create cool vector art). But I&apos;m switching to it&apos;s sister <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> because Sodipodi can&apos;t seem to export their own art without crashing itself (BOO! >:( ).

Tomorrow&apos;s the meeting with the dreaded SAD department. I&apos;m really looking forward to something that would prove my perceptions wrong all the while.{%- endmark %}
