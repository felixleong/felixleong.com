After all that pented fury being release elsewhere (my LJ, actually), it seems that I&apos;m able to get my defensiveness and ego down to go to meet up with the Students Affairs Department (I wonder whether I should capitalise that… Any English grammarians around?). But nonetheless I&apos;m feeling a bit nervous when I entered the room, then pretty much my priorities are being set straight: That I would really want this to work out and I want the freshmen to have a booklet that would set the expectations and hopes for the university themselves.

Then I remember what the message that I really wanted to convey, in whatever art form I design: A beginning of journey with hopes, together with a sense of togetherness, unity and harmony, to set out for a change for the better.

So yeah, with that in mind, I have more creative energy to do more designs now :).

So I&apos;ll post up any new designs that came to mind over here and I would really appreciate any feedback from you ^^. Hopefully it&apos;ll come out to be great ^^b.

This morning when I was at the bus stop, a butterfly just seem to captivate me ^^, an orange one in fact. Then looking back, there&apos;s more of them :D.

… Just one of those things that I didn&apos;t notice all the while, I guess. :)

Anyway, classes in half an hour, and I really need to grab something for lunch. See you guys then! :)

There&apos;s a lot of reasons for me to be happy today, and one, no, three of the most important one is that:
1. Today&apos;s Stanley&apos;s birthday :3
2. …And my parents&apos; wedding anniversary! Congrats for 23 years of being in marriage and as much I know you guys never read my LJ, I&apos;m proud of having you as parents *HUGZ!!!*
3. … I&apos;ll save that for tommorrow&apos;s entry :).

I think I just give my parents a ring tonight :3.
