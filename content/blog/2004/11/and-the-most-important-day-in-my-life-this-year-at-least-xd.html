{% mark post -%}今日は僕の誕生日です！^^

Oh yes! Today&apos;s my big double two&apos;s ^^, and that signifies the beginning of my 23rd year in life :).

Since I&apos;ll be working <strike>tommorrow</strike> today, so Erika, Steven, Rachael, Soo Hoo and Carin (Did I spelt that right?) throw a small birthday party for me <strike>today</strike> yesterday *^^*. Albiet a bit small, but it&apos;s extremely sweet of them…. :). *glomps them all*

So today I got two birthday presents :3. One is from Grace, who gave me a cool ornament bottle. Basically it&apos;s a bottle filled with blue liquid with some silvery substance, which, when you turn it over like a snowglobe, you&apos;ll see all these silvery substances mix up with blue substance and it creates some sort of a moving satin/silky effect. Which is really cool visual effects <333.

The second gift is given by Erika (and her friends, I guess)… is a pair of clothing: it&apos;s basically a white T-shirt coupled with a yellow shirt with a grid pattern. Heard from Steven that Erika choose it after long hours of selection, and I was wondering whether Erika did her research before hand, or did she actually knows what I like? :3 Just gotta love that girl *glomps!* (Oh yeah, Erika, this is actually what I mentioned to the others while you are away with your phone call)

After that, we talked for like… hours and hours, nonstop just about everything, and we had quite a lot of fun *^^*. And what makes this even special is that I haven&apos;t had such a fun party ever since I entered college. <333 Thanks a lot for everything! :3 Too bad we didn&apos;t have a camera to capture all the fun moments, but it&apos;s kept inside my brain ;). But I&apos;ll take a good photo of my presents later when I had the chance.

So what else… Yeah, I rememebered the wrong date of my parents&apos; wedding anniversary, it&apos;s actually tommorrow :p. So yeah for me being forgetful with dates XD.

Anyway~ I still have another good 22 hours to enjoy my special day today. And yeah, I share the same birthday with my country&apos;s prime minister, so yeah XDDDD.

… So~ Sore ja!


<b>[:: NOTE ::]</b>
Just for the fun of it, for those who are going to type birthday wishes comments (well… at least I know I should receive a few… I think XDDD), just let me just add another request :p: If you were to give me something as a present, what would it be? :3 It can be anything: A Internet site, a drawing, some creative writing work… or perhaps even a blank promise that I&apos;ll never expect you to fulfill it. :p

There! Post on! :D{%- endmark %}
