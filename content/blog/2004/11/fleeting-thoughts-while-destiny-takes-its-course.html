{% mark post -%}<b>Scene:</b> A tired Felix sitting in front of the computer, while enjoying his fair share of sushi ^^. Yum!

<b>Thoughts:</b> Fleeting thoughts… revolving a sense of sorrow, yet the sorrow seems so beautiful, seemingly to cherish every small things in life…


<b>Work:</b> Nothing less of a roller-coaster ride itself. But at least my reading list doesn&apos;t get piled up lately.

<b>School:</b> The usual: ASSIGNMENTS!!!! *screams and run around in circles* Japanese class tomorrow, it&apos;ll be greetings this week ^^.

<b>Internet-Related Event:</b> If there&apos;s no accident, you can catch me on MSN during work. Of course, don&apos;t type too much that my boss might feel suspicious ^^". And secondly, Erika&apos;s (sayinmango) having a LiveJournal *^^*.


<b>Family:</b> Will be going back to my parents&apos; next Saturday <333.{%- endmark %}
