Make it a short one:

Ever since the past few weeks… I just feel some sort of anxiety and apprehension, which gets stronger and stronger by the day.

Some change is occuring… and I know it&apos;s there and yet I really don&apos;t know what is going to change.

An apprehension to something unknown… heh, as much on the surface it&apos;s seems funny and unfounded, but deep down… I know it&apos;s not.

Should I embrace it? Or should I wait and see? But the feeling… is so strong that it&apos;s hard for me not to pay attention on it.

…

Closing my eyes… I see myself… in a stream of constant change… Thoughts fleeting past me, people walking past me… every single second retiring…

Is changing oneself hard? Or is it that staying true to oneself is harder? I will never know… until I begin my journey…
