I just received this text message from my sister, and she&apos;s so sweet that I&apos;m really touched to tears &lt;=3.

Just to post it up here:

喂，生日快乐啦！本来打算昨天半夜祝福你的不过后来太累了忘记，听讲很多人帮你庆祝噢！你就好啦最重要的是有女朋友嘛！开心吗？心里的矛盾明朗了吗？今天又会去那里通畅一顿啊?好好的出去癫一下啦！虽然我不全了解你在那儿过的是怎样的生活，不过只要你觉得开心就好。下月我会下去噢！再看吧。

<strong><u>Translation:</u></strong>

Hey, happy birthday! I was thinking of sending my best wishes to you at midnight, I&apos;m too tired that I forgot about it. I heard that there&apos;s a lot of friends celebrating it with you! I&apos;m so jealous (:p), the most important thing is that you already have a girlfriend! (Ed: Umm…. XDDD Well, actually I would say there&apos;s a big possibility that I would give it another go when the time is right… which won&apos;t be long… I guess XDDD)

Are you happy/having fun? Is all the contradictions in your heart being loosen up? (Ed: The meaning isn&apos;t exactly that… but that&apos;s pretty much the meaning) Where would you go today? Just be out there and go all out! Although I don&apos;t understand fully how&apos;s your life been over there, but just make sure that you feel happy.

I&apos;ll be coming over next month! We&apos;ll see then! :)

Sometimes I just feel a bit guilty though… It&apos;s like… all my great friends and family always seems to understand how I feel and give me encouragement when I needed it most, and yet it seems that I didn&apos;t do anything back in return. Well… I suppose sometimes these kind of thanks are hard to express in words… so we didn&apos;t get to know, I guess… &lt;=3
