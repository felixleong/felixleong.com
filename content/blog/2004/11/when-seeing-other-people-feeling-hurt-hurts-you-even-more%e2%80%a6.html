<i>(F) sayin mango: it&apos;s funny ha…
(F) sayin mango: maybe it&apos;s a thing for all the guys…
(F) sayin mango: to play with women&apos;s heart like tat…
…
(F) sayin mango: u expect me to forget all this….and be really close frens with u as usual…
(F) sayin mango: i will never forget tat u said u loved me and wanna be with me…</i>

For these words hurts me the most… I just can&apos;t stand but feeling… so deeply painful that I really can&apos;t bear it… that really made me feel like a jerk.


<i>Felix Leong -- To Understand and To Feel: i never seek forgiveness… for the things i failed you, i deserved to be dead
Felix Leong -- To Understand and To Feel: i never seek you to forget… for i know that how much these memories would worth… to love someone deeply</i>

…

Crap… I remembered sometime ago… that I dream about this… typing this very entry in my own dreams… and now I&apos;m typing on the keyboard… in which every key press click pricks my heart…

Sorry that I failed you Erika… I really do.

<i>Felix Leong -- To Understand and To Feel: i consider myself as a failure… to give you the best that you deserve as an individual</i>

I just hoped… that you know… that all the while I have been sincere… and every single thing I do is true from the heart with no intention to hurt or fool around with your feelings. Sorry that I can&apos;t give you physical closeness… or the kind of love you seek… if that were to give you to greatest happiness.

I have to put this friends-only for obvious reasons… so… there….
