<p>Anyone needs a guess why I put this journal title again? :p Some habits are just that hard to improve.

Walking in the rain isn&apos;t totally fun, especially when you need to walk for about 30 minutes in the rain (in total). Other than that, wellâ€¦ life&apos;s pretty much normal. Although I do hate when Alfred keeps on piling stuff on my table to read (as if I&apos;ll be able to magically make those code examples work together as a totally working and perfect program in one second).

Anyway, guess I should be back to work now. Ja &apos;ne!</p>
