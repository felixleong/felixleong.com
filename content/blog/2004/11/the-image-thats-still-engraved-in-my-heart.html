{% mark post -%}Sweet memories will still be there… as much I tried not to look back…

<img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/artwork/choonhui.png">

The very smile… which gave me the strength… will always live on. As much as I always doubt my own decisions… his words… telling me to move on… to look forward… in the eyes of what&apos;s ahead of me.

It&apos;s time for me to move forward… and appreciate what I have and to strive for what I have wanted to achieve.

…It&apos;s hard for me to cry…
…For you have gave me enough strength to feel strong…{%- endmark %}
