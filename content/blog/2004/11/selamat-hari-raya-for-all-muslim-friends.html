Today&apos;s a big yeah for our fellow Muslim friends: They finally endure their fasting month! (at least those over here :p) So yeah, the end of Ramadan. And it also a day to seek forgiveness and to remember that family ties are always important (OK, that&apos;s pretty much all that I know about the Muslim culture ^^")

Anyway, I&apos;m back at home now :). Wellâ€¦ as much I have to do some school work and stuff, everything&apos;s pretty relaxed at home. That&apos;s home sweet home for you *^^*.

Gotta go! Ja &apos;ne! :)
