Anyway, I&apos;m back at work, still pulling hair out to program encryption stuff for the company. X( Bleh… With all the education/Cryptography classes I have taken (at least last semester), the theory does needs some digesting before I can cough out some practical codes X(.

Anyway, 8 hours more… I hope that I can win that Maharaja HI-NRG Night Vol. 11 from eBay (Gorky Park and Babe Follow Me <3333). *crosses fingers*
