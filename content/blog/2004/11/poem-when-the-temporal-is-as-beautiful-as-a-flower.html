You gave me so much courage
It&apos;s really hard for me to cry
You gave me so much happiness
It&apos;s really hard for me to feel sad
You gave me so much strength
It&apos;s really hard for me to show my pain

… I see you
smiling back at me
The very same smile you had all the while
And yet it wasn&apos;t the same smile that I used to know…

…I see you…
So close, yet so distant
As if your eyes are telling me
"My job is done"

I seem to hear your silent voice
Saying to me softly…
That I&apos;m already able
To be on my own

I seem to notice your eyes
Telling me kindly…
That I&apos;ll be there… watching you
To be happy and alive

It&apos;s really hard for me to turn my back on you and walk my way
But the courage you gave me asked me to bring more courage in others
It&apos;s really hard for me to hold back my tears and find my joy
But the happiness you gave me asked me to bring more happiness in others
It&apos;s really hard for me to swallow the pain and pick on the journey
But the strength you gave me asked me to bring more strength in others

I&apos;m now alone… in another adventure without you
But I&apos;m keeping my eyes on you
To see you happy and alive
My job is only starting… from now and forever…
