{% mark post -%}<p>Well… today&apos;s a pretty normal day. The only shocking part is that… My numerical analysis mid-terms is on next Saturday while my finals is on 6 December O_O". And I haven&apos;t even touch ANYTHING yet &gt;.&lt;". Not to mention my final year project stuff, work and the design for the orientation booklet. (seeing myself having a hard time juggling responsibilities ._.").

Anyway, other than that, yay for me donating blood for the eighth time :3. The first-aid society is getting better and better as we see more sponsorship coming in (seeing that our souvenirs and our gift pack is getting bigger and bigger). The only quirk is that it&apos;s the first time I ever donated 450cc of blood (my usual is 300cc… you know, being underweight and stuff :p), thanks to wrong weighing scale reading XDDDD (and I was like… hey! Why not giving 450cc a go :p) And that pretty much gave me some slight dizziness and fatigue later :p. But the gift pack filled with milk and stuff always help. Mmmmm~ :)

Japanese class today is good as usual :). Today we touch on numerals and stuff. The basic grammar stuff is pretty much easy, considering that I self learn some basics before I come for class, but the pronunciation is definitely an experience: I didn&apos;t notice how much mistakes I thought myself during the process of self-learning XD.

So… basically, that&apos;s my day. Anyway, gotta go now, got some artwork to deal with (umm… for the orientation booklet)</p>{%- endmark %}
