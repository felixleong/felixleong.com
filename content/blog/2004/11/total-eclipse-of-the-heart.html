Hot damn this song seems to grow in me so dramatically that it always makes me wanna cry. :) It&apos;s just a beautiful song, I somewhat recalled that I have listened to the original on the radio when I was a kid, and never knowing that it&apos;ll make me like it so much. :) Think I really need to dig the song out from somewhere, at least the original :). [It&apos;s in my Ultra Parapara Dance Nonstop Megamix CD, by the way]

Anyway~ The lyrics~

<b>Total Eclipse of The Heart (Eurobeat Version) / Nikki French</b>
(Original by Bonnie Tyler)

Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and
you&apos;re never coming round.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of
listning to the sound of my tears.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
that the best of all the years have gone by.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
and then I see the look in your eyes.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and the I fall apart.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and the I fall apart.

Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit restless
and I dream of something wild.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
and I&apos;m lying like a child in your arms.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit angry and
I know I&apos;ve got to get out and cry.
Turn around…
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I see the look
in your eyes.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and the I fall apart.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and the I fall apart.

And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever.
And if you only hold me tight we&apos;ll be holding on forever.
And we&apos;ll only be making it right &apos;cause we&apos;ll never be wrong.
Together we can take it to the end of the line.
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.
I don&apos;t know what to do and I&apos;m always in the dark.
We&apos;re living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.

I really need you tonight, forever&apos;s gonna start tonight,
Forever&apos;s gonna start tonight.

Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I&apos;m only falling apart.
There&apos;s nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.
Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there&apos;s only love in
the dark.
Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart.

Turn around, bright eyes…
Turn around, bright eyes…

Turn around…
Every now and then I know you&apos;ll never be the boy you always wanted to be.
Turn around…
But every now and then I know you&apos;ll always be the only boy who wanted me
the way that I am.
Turn around…
Every now and then I know there&apos;s no one in the universe as magical and
wondrous as you.
Turn around…
Every now and then I know there&apos;s nothing any better, there&apos;s nothing
that I just wouldn&apos;t do.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and then I fall apart.
Turn around, bright eyes…
Every now and then I fall apart.

And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever.
And if you only hold me tight we&apos;ll be holding on forever.
And we&apos;ll only be making it right &apos;cause we&apos;ll never be wrong.
Together we can take it to the end of the line.
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time.
I don&apos;t know what to do and I&apos;m always in the dark.
We&apos;re living in a powder keg and giving off sparks.

I really need you tonight, forever&apos;s gonna start tonight,
Forever&apos;s gonna start tonight.

Once upon a time I was falling in love but now I&apos;m only falling apart.
There&apos;s nothing I can do, a total eclipse of the heart.
Once upon a time there was light in my life but now there&apos;s only love in
the dark.
Nothing I can say, a total eclipse of the heart.
A total eclipse of the heart, a total eclipse of the heart.

Turn around, bright eyes,
Turn around, bright eyes, turn around.

I&apos;m currently working on a choreograph for the song :). I just need the nail down the chorus, b-melo and c-melo (and GOD it&apos;s tough XDDD).

Working for three weeks let me notice something: I feel so naked without sleeping with a blanket :&apos;(.

Will be going back to my parents&apos; place today <333. So I&apos;ll keep you guys updated.

Lastly, I won the MHNNR11 CD~ Bweeee~~~ <333 (Babe Follow Me, you&apos;re my loving destiny~~~)
