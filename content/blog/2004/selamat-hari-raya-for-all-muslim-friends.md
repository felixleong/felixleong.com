Today's a big yeah for our fellow Muslim friends: They finally endure their fasting month! (at least those over here :p) So yeah, the end of Ramadan. And it also a day to seek forgiveness and to remember that family ties are always important (OK, that's pretty much all that I know about the Muslim culture ^^")

Anyway, I'm back at home now :). Wellâ€¦ as much I have to do some school work and stuff, everything's pretty relaxed at home. That's home sweet home for you *^^*.

Gotta go! Ja 'ne! :)
