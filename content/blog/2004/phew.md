My emotions are pretty much mixed today. This morning I made a call to the computer shop to ask whether my CD-ROM is back yet, and they somewhat gave me a rude reply saying that it not ready yet (OK, maybe it's because the standard of English isn't good here and I'm just over-reacting). Not to mention that I got hung up at the first time when I called not knowing what's happening. Grr… (I might consider not buying from them anymore, but some of their support staff are really friendly, ah well…)

During the afternoon, I was feeling so tired for unknown reasons that I don't feel like getting up in the first place. Then my aunt came to pay us (me and another aunt of mine who is staying temporarily) a visit, and I really like to be with her because we do share common views towards some things (her mindset is really modern and open to new views). Although it was fun, however I'm still feeling tired.

Then at 7:30p.m., I became a little bit nervous, because I'm constantly thinking of the worst case scenario that no one will come for our small developer hanging out session. Luckily two show up today, so at least it wasn't too bad :). Imagine having a master storyteller and another one with travelling experience sitting on the same table, I'm sure it isn't hard to imagine that there'll be lots of interesting conversation going on there (although I personally do most of the listening, which is part of the fun anyway).

So now I'm at home, still feeling awake… and typing this! :)

Oh! By the way, I got this quiz and here's the result I get:
