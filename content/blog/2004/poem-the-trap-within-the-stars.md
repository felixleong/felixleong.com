Well… Getting A BEST is definitely a bad idea: it made me all sentimental all of a sudden XDDD. Great compilation CD <333.

Anyway, just wrote this… originally in Chinese (wow! It's been YEARS I have written Chinese), for those who understand Chinese, click here:

## 星空のTRAP

何时又跌入单恋的陷阱  
何时又扮演受伤的角色  
一心想要脱离  
 那反复不停的剧本  
 再重新再来过的我  
为何又让我发现了你？

孤单的夜里  
 总是习惯了孤单的  
 被遥远的星星围绕  
还记得小时候吗？  
人家说向流星许愿  
 会得到幸福的哦！  
我的梦想就好像这样  
 在星空中编织  
 希望有那一天那一颗  
  幸运星降临

自从何时  
 我把你编织在那星空中？  
明知道你是那么的靠近  
 却让我感到那么的遥远？

何时又跌入单恋的陷阱  
何时又扮演受伤的角色  
一心想要脱离  
 那反复不停的剧本  
 再重新再来过的我  
为何又让我发现了你？

在那喧哗的都市  
 总是习惯了孤单的  
 和过路人檫肩而过  
还记得那时候吗？  
人家说在繁华的都市里  
 会有和你命中注定的人哦！  
我的梦想就好像这样  
 在星空中编织  
 希望有那一天那一颗  
  幸运星降临

自从何时  
 我会在意你的存在？  
明知道你有了别人  
 却让我感到心酸？

自从何时  
 我会为了你流了不少泪？  
明知道和你一起有可能  
 却让我感到那么的无力尝试？

何时又跌入单恋的陷阱  
何时又扮演受伤的角色  
一心想要脱离  
 那反复不停的剧本  
 再重新再来过的我  
为何又让我发现了你？

我的梦想就好像这样  
 在星空中编织  
或许完美的你  
 比较适合在那星空中飘舞  
但是…  
 我还是  
  希望有那一天那一颗  
   幸运星降临

你…会降临于我吗…？

For the rest of you who don't, here's a English translation (I did polish it a little):

## The Trap Within The Stars

Since when I fall into the crush trap again  
Since when I act as the wounded again  
I really wanted to get out  
 From that repeating script  
 And to start all over again  
Yet why I just happen to notice you?

In those lonely nights  
 I'm already used to being alone  
 Surrounded by the star fields far away  
Remember the time when we were small?  
They said that when you wish upon a shooting star  
 You'll be able to get happiness  
My dreams are just like that  
 Woven in the star fields  
 Wishing that one day  
  That lucky star will fall upon me

Since when  
 I have you woven among the starry skies?  
I already knew that you are that close  
 Yet why I still feel that you are still far away?

Since when I fall into the crush trap again  
Since when I act as the wounded again  
I really wanted to get out  
 From that repeating script  
 And to start all over again  
Yet why I just happen to notice you?

In that busy streets here  
 I'm already used to being alone  
 Rubbing shoulders among the estranged crowds  
Remember that time?  
They said that in that busy streets  
 There's someone destinied to you!  
My dreams are just like that  
 Woven in the star fields  
 Wishing that one day  
  That lucky star will fall upon me

Since when  
 I mind your existence?  
I already knew that you already have someone else  
 Yet why I'm still feeling hurt inside?

Since when  
 I cried a river for you?  
I already knew that I might have a chance with you  
 Yet why I just feel tired to try?

Since when I fall into the crush trap again  
Since when I act as the wounded again  
I really wanted to get out  
 From that repeating script  
 And to start all over again  
Yet why I just happen to notice you?

My dreams are just like that  
 Woven in the star fields  
Maybe you are just perfect  
 to dance with the stars above  
But…  
 I still wished  
  Wishing that one day  
   That lucky star will fall upon me

Will you… fall upon me…?

Hope you enjoy it as much as I do ;)
