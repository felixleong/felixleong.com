Maybe it's just me, but I think I'm bound to hate Tuesdays in odd weeks because there's only one hour of lecture during that day in odd weeks (we have two tutorials in even weeks). Judging from how much time I have to spend just to get to school, it's just so not-worth it! (as much looking at the bright side of things that can be my honeymoon day of the week)

Worse, that also means that I'll not be able to see Choon Hui for long ;\_;. That cruel because now I'm starting to miss him. (but then again, I should miss him more during the weekends instead XDD)

I just went to a warehouse sale held by WordWare (it's a distributed for MS Press in Malaysia… Yup, it's books all right!), but then I didn't know where their office is, not to mention that I really want to go there by bus (judging that I have no transportation what so ever). So I just check StreetDirectory.com for the map, and notice that one of the bus will get through there for sure, and I went out for some adventure alone ^^.

I can't believe that everything went on so smoothly that I reached there effortlessly ^^ (as much as I went there only for the first time and I'm really bad with directions). The staff there are really friendly, and I got myself some expensive books for cheap ^^b.

Can't wait to tell my friends about it.

As for now… well… I really miss Choon Hui here ;\_\_\_;.

(and gosh I wonder what will happen to me if:

- I really manage to have him as my boyfriend
- he avoids me like plague when he knew about this)
