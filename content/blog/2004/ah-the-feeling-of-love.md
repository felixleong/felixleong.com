Now I noticed that I really like smart people with a sweet and friendly personality ^^. A sweet smile is always a definate plus. (Looking back, all my crushes does share this similarity)

Ah~ I'm getting the crush again, which is always a good thing, I would say ^^. What's make it sweeter is that he mentioned that he's biâ€¦ Well, he spoke it in pretty much in a jokingly sort of way, but something tells me that it's real. Well, even if he's straight, he seemed cool about it ^^.

Oh joy! Let me just flag him as my next target :p. Yum!
