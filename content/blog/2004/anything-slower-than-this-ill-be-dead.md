GAH! Our university's intranet is getting on my nerves! The reason? Today's the day when the supplementary paper (i.e. resit) candidate list is out and apparently EVERYONE is making their way there. And it really seems that the school is unable to afford a webhost which has a higher bandwidth or anything which makes the darn website loading slowly.

AUGH! Somebody ought to kill me!

[p/s: As said before, I might fail my math paper. But stillâ€¦ just wish me luck :)]
