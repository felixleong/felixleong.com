Sweet memories will still be there… as much I tried not to look back…

The very smile… which gave me the strength… will always live on. As much as I always doubt my own decisions… his words… telling me to move on… to look forward… in the eyes of what's ahead of me.

It's time for me to move forward… and appreciate what I have and to strive for what I have wanted to achieve.

…It's hard for me to cry…

…For you have gave me enough strength to feel strong…
