If there's a happy, happy day this year, this have to be it.

Anyway, our Interpersonal Communication lecturer ROCKS! My lectures and tutorials are so packed with fun that I just can't stop laughing my head off. Not to mention Ms Nicole (lecturer) and Ms Alugu (tutor) have a really good sense of humour while recounting their stories and joke around when they tried to introduce a new concept! <3

Now I do have something serious to look forward to at school. ^^ (and I guess this will be the time when I really would do my homework voluntarily)

Then the next thing of course is definitely Choon Hui. Well, he didn't show up in the morning, which made me a little bit disappointed. But the Interpersonal Communication class made up for it. Later at noon, I'm quite pleased that he show up during my Cryptography classes (one of the boring Math classes, and I definitely need him to stay awake XD). What sweeter is that my friends managed to get places two rows back from him, so I have a really close view of him. *SQUEE~!* And as if that's not enough, throw in another crush (Bean, which is my first crush whom I have gave up hope) sitting on my back and that makes the picture so complete that… well…. I don't know where to look XDDD.

Later after class, I finally found a great chance to get close to Choon Hui and talk to him. And all of a sudden he just asked whether I would like to donate for a good cause, and I'm like "huh?". Then he showed me today's paper which shows a poor family of six or something with their seriously ill father having diabetes. OK, I confessed that I didn't read the whole thing and I admit that he got my soft spot (him and donating for a good cause, I guess he didn't notice the former though). But it's just a kind of genuine gesture of him that I didn't get suspicious nor hesitate to stuff him 10 bucks without any rational thoughts. And yeah for my stupidity because he's my current crush.

Gosh! I can't resist someone with a heart of gold and I'm now melting. Gosh! He better don't score higher in my books or I'll get crushed harder if:

- I ever fail to have him, or
- his perfect image is being smashed due to one wrong doing of his in the future.

Oh gosh… I'm just wishing that I can keep Choon Hui for myself now… .\_."

Oh! by the way, stolen this from maryssa:

Oh gosh I never knew diseases can be deadly in a cute way.

[::UPDATE::]

Oh gosh I REALLY liked the flu, bookworm and the common cold ^^. And it's not that expensive either! (Hey! US$6 = RM21.80 is really a deal ^^) … But the shipping is like… US$15.34?!

Oh crap… T-T
