I guess it's pretty much engraved deep in my genes that I can't sleep at any time before midnight. However, on the side of the story, I'm also pretty much "cursed" with my own sleeping habit that I must have at least 6 hours of sleep in order to wake up by instincts.

As much as I knew this as a fact, my ignorance got the better of me and I ended up having a nasty day for that. So the story goes when I stayed up late at night to finish up my readings summary (call it additional school work if you want). And although I know my own sleeping patterns and the early morning class the next day, yet I ignore my inner voice that I need to leave everything for tommorow.

The ending is pretty much obvious: screams, a pair of sleepy eyes, an empty stomach, constant rushing, missing the bus… and finally: late for class -\_-". Luckily it's only a normal lecture, but I'm not too happy when I found out that the lecturer isn't one of my favourites… (that's a over polite statement). And I have to put up with a not-so-good mood, making sure that I don't doze off, and a rusty brain.

Blah… that surely thought me a good lesson that I don't think that I would ever learn…. May you have a good night sleep today… *yawn*
