My chripy mood during the day all went to the drain just now… well apparently I just broke out the news (you know which one) to one of my best friends via SMS, and he put it bluntly (but a polite one) that not interested with… um, gay relationship. The comment just seem to be like a sharp arrow shot straight through me, but I do understand and know his stand regarding the issue and the comment. But I'm glad he has found a love interest and he deserves to have one for being such a nice guy… as much as I am wiping a lot of tears while keying in messages on my cell.

Now I had totally lost any interest to do my reading for now, I really hoped that Allen is within hugable distance. But… instead what I had now is my own pillow. Guess I have to settle for something that I have now. *sobs, whimpers and cries… very hard* Maybe I should just go to bed now and get over with it.

In other news, today's my aunt's birthday. But judging from my current mood, I guess I won't be in the mood of doing anything special for her… Perhaps I might just give her a warm Happy Birthday and that's it… *sobs*

Well… but this did brigthen up my current mood… by a very little margin:

Got a better score than what I had for Felix (well… Felix was a nick anyway) :p. But still… Maybe I should head for bed while my tears flow down on my cheeks.

[p/s: Perhaps I might just screen some of my real-life friends out from the news, which is pretty much almost all of them… ;_;]
