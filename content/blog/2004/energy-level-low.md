I'm not sick today, but I'm feeling all tired when I woke up. You know, one of those days which you feel total without energy and just lost interest in almost everything that you feel like slouching in bed doing nothing. Ugh… I hate this.

But I still manage to drag myself up and do something, doing the laundry and then do some more pixel arts samples to get the job. And I just finish with the background of my sample game… and this time it's much more sinister :p. Here's the art I have done:

Other than that, it's a boring day… well, I guess when you feel lethargic, everything sucks anyway :p.

[:: Random Event ::]

- My brother is in the town where my previous college is and he saw someone who looks *exactly* like me. o\_O" And he called up and confirm that I'm not there in the first place.

Weird~ XD
