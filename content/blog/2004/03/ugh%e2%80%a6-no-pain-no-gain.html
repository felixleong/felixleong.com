Playing truant again just to fix up my assignment, and I have been spending the whole morning just to fix those out of sync parts of the animation, and finally I&apos;m able to finish the Flash with some minor quirks here and there which I&apos;m too frustrated to fix. I might just review it this Sunday and make some tweaks later, but for now… forget it, I have been experiencing the "fix one part and break the other" once too many.

However, this assignment comes with a price though: I have been experiencing some nagging back-pain, some nauseating feeling when I stare in front of a radiation for too long, headaches… Duh >.<". Kind of remind me of those health warning that usually printed in game manuals that ask us to take a 15 minute break after an hour of gaming. Let&apos;s face it, THAT&apos;s the line of advice that we often ignore! Well, guess I have to take their advice from now.

Well, later in the afternoon, my aunt seems to notice that I&apos;m at home (which I should be at school) and she asks me "Didn&apos;t you have class today?" and I&apos;m like "Yeah, but I have to finish my assignments." and she just gave me an "Ai-ye…" kind of response and left my room. I don&apos;t whether I should take it as a disgruntle response since she did told me once that she believes that we should attend classes in order to understand the material.

Can&apos;t stop but feeling annoyed by that thought… but she do have her point. Great…
