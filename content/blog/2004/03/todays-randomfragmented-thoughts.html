Lately I got a whole scatter of undeveloped thought about my own feelings that I can&apos;t seem to organize them well, till I have the time to sort them out, here&apos;s a quick list of some:


<b>[:: Random Thoughts ::]</b>
- How people perceive right and wrong… I don&apos;t know, I have been thinking of that question from the start and the interest resparked in me when I&apos;m having moral classes. Is opinions is really related to our past experiences? Or is it already manipulated by social norms? Or maybe both? Issues has been floating around in my head lately
- Love… yeah, I think I&apos;m thinking waaaay too much about that lately. But the funny thing is this: What my own desires towards that? Is it that I really wanted someone to love and begin a relationship? Or is it that I can&apos;t find a friend close enough for me to share my thoughts with? I&apos;m still working on that "unenigmatic" enigma
- Sometimes when people chat online, we always presume that we are chatting in real time, but in actual fact it&apos;s not: Computers are really special because we can multitask (i.e. Doing a lot of other stuff), so the person on the other side might be busy while we are still waiting for replies. As much we are notified by that fact, sometimes I seem to forget that fact and feeling like a jackass who speaks too much later. Hmm… I think I really need a life XD
- …What&apos;s the real purpose of education? Does it really build character? Or is it a "social expectancy" that someone must be educated in order to get a better job/life? It always seems to me like we aren&apos;t really studying for ourselves but for passing exams and finishing up assignments… Well… at least the utopian role of the education system works if school is more inspiring, but then again… what is inspiring???

Guess I leave that for now, till then… hugs to all of you who are feeling really depressed lately. (And back to my Flash assignments and mid-terms)
