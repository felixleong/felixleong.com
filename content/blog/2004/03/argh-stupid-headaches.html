Stress attack! Great, mathematics always get me headaches, especially when I&apos;m totally ill-prepared for today&apos;s quiz (Gah! Two questions and I have one of them totally blank *dies*) Ah well… Look like there&apos;s a lot of catching up to do. :p

Perhaps it&apos;s due to stress level or the heat around me, I have been having an annoying headache, it&apos;s nothing major, but it&apos;s just bothering to have it there while I&apos;m going on with my daily tasks. Thank god my flash assignment is seeing better progress and I had almost finished Try Me ^_^ v. Hopefully I can finish the project this week and go on with other stuff. But… *looks at the expiration date* gah! My trial version for Flash MX 2004 is going to end tomorrow! Thank god I had the evaluation copy of the older Flash MX to act as backup :p. But I better pray that it doesn&apos;t mess up with my previous works, I hate to readjust most of the stuff that I had done until now.

And yeah… it&apos;s boring lately. That&apos;s all.
