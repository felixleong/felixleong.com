Ah… Student Affairs Department… sounds more to me like a Student Torture Chamber. OK, the staff there aren&apos;t that bad like what I had just described just now, but there&apos;s one that I know about them: I don&apos;t like to go there in the first place. Sheesh… OK, it&apos;s really not that bad, but there&apos;s just one officer over there who has a dang lot of nervous energy that she always amplifies one mistake like it&apos;s was a catastrophe in the public eye (OK, I&apos;m slightly exaggerating, but you get the point). Worse still, the department is so underemployed that the staff also has inherited the same nervous energy. Geez… That means that when I going there to get my loan forms handed up or passing up posters, they would scrutinize every single detail like a vulture waiting for its prey (in this case, they&apos;re like giving me the impression that I can go wrong with everything!) And since I get nervous very easily, I&apos;m like walking through the minefield whenever I wanted to open that door.

On the other hand, the head of that department is pretty much the opposite: as much she would like things to be in control, she&apos;s pretty calm in nature and she always assure us that as long we work together, we can iron things straight. Sigh… if we had more people like that.

Anyway, today&apos;s moral class is about Aristotle&apos;s Mean Virtues. Woo… it&apos;s kind of fun that the lecturer putting it simply as being matured in terms of our thinking and actions. Moral classes are fun (although the SAD has made me skipped a quarter of it #$#^$*)
