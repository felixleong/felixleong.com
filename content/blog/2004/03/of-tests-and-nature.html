Te…te…te…TESTS!!! Gah! >_<

Well… as you might have guessed, this is the evil mid-term tests/assignment dues week. So I&apos;m back to my bad habit in rushing and picking up whatever late minute stuff that I forget. School is evil (so is real life).

OK, enough rants, I just recall back what happened this morning:
Basically it&apos;s just a typical morning when I have to drag myself to school, as much I hated school, I always like the walk to get there, because along the road to school, the road side is planted with a lot of shady trees and grass. More often than not, you&apos;ll see a lot of yellow petals slowing gliding down from the tree down to the ground.

However, when I walked along the same road again, the scenery isn&apos;t totally the same… I found out that some of the trees has been chopped down. The reasons for that is pretty much unknown, but when I see the tree trunk and barks being segmented into various pieces, I can&apos;t help but feeling a little bit sad. As much the position of the tree is a little bit dangerous (it&apos;s next to a big ditch, so there&apos;s a possibility that the tree might collapse some time or the other. However I can&apos;t stop but thinking why nature have to give way to development? But thinking about it, everything is pretty much a cycle by itself, till then the balance is broken and it&apos;s natures turn to destroy us. Hmm…

Thinking back, I saw the grass field at the back of our class room is being tarred to become a parking lot for motorcycles…
