Just for the stress relief, here&apos;s something for your reading pleasure:

<b><u>Helpless: A Cry For Help</u></b>
As if planets are revolving around me
It seems like everything around me is twirling
As I close my eyes and hope that this will stop
It didn&apos;t
Everything is swirling inside as well

Every time when people ask me how do I do
I just answered that I&apos;ve been juggling with too much work
As I tried to let them go and hope that this will stop
It didn&apos;t
It&apos;s seems that I&apos;m the one being juggled

As if the force of gravity has increase its strength
It seems that I can barely walk with my legs planted on the ground
As I tried to sit down and hope that I can rest
It didn&apos;t
Everything around me is forcing me to go on

Every time when people ask me how do I do?
I just smiled… say everything is OK
As I close my eyes and hope chaos will stop
It didn&apos;t
A silent cry of help is amplifying deep inside…

As if I have become someone with a sealed mouth
It seems that my feelings aren&apos;t able to be voiced out
As I close my eyes and pray that someone can listen to my little voice
Crying for help
… Did it? Or it didn&apos;t?

I did notice that my poem structure and style didn&apos;t changed much until now… Hmm… I wonder is it a good thing? :p
