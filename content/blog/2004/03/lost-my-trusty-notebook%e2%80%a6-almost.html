{% mark post -%}Nothing really special occur to me today, but I almost thought that my trusty notebook is going to be lost today. In case you are wondering, the notebook that I mentioned isn&apos;t the computer kind of notebook (which I use to type this journal every time ;) ), but a ring-binded, navy blue paper notebook (or notepad, which some might put it).

Basically if you peep inside my notebook, it isn&apos;t much stuff inside: My almighty timetable, things that I jotted down, a few fragmented ideas, and perhaps a lot of artwork scribbles (a few poems has been taken out from there, although most of them are typed into my computer). Think of it, it really isn&apos;t something that anyone would considered important or scream about, but I panicked when I forgot where I left it. But thank god, a friend found it somewhere and returned it back to me.

Phew! Close call. I think I better remember to take my personal stuff next time (as much as I know that I have a really nasty forgetful nature)

My favourite game music MIDI search engine is back up again! Wee! <a href="http://www.dtm.ac/">Computer Music Center</a> IS in Japanese, but I guess you can guess which link to click ;){%- endmark %}
