{% mark post -%}Today I just received another message from my ex-crush asking me out for supper… and I just staring at my cell… and replied to him that I&apos;m going to be free afterwards. As much as I already knew he&apos;s going to talk about some Internet business that I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll be interested in, my aching heart just don&apos;t allow to say no in meeting him…

Slouching on my chair facing the monitor, the screen is reflecting my teary eyes… a sight that I don&apos;t really want to see… miserable… still clinging on a fantasy that won&apos;t realise… How many times that I tell myself that I have to be strong? How many times that I had tried to let the feeling go? How many times that I had tried to hold my tears…?

However… the longer I hold back my desire of loving him, the more that my desire to be loved by someone special grows. As much I have accepted the fact and believed that I&apos;ll be able to find another love, my subconscious mind always connects the word "love" with him without much thought. As much as I have decided to move forward, I can&apos;t stop but turning my head to the past… and reopen the Pandora&apos;s box all over again?

How many times have I hugged a pillow for a sense of being loved and security? How many times I have met with interesting people but holding back because of the haunting pain? How many times that I have experienced the strong desire of being loved by someone… to a point that it hurts?

I guess I&apos;ll get better as soon as my tears dry up and I&apos;ll be able to move on with my life… yet I just don&apos;t know when will this nagging and sad feeling will stop and reincarnate into a strong positive energy… Does anyone know when will that be? Maybe by the time I&apos;m able to get over it? How long would that be?…

In other news, my Flash assignment is almost done despite of some nasty Windows crashes. Hopefully it&apos;ll be done by tomorrow and I&apos;ll be able to shift my attention to my other assignments. And as for tonight, I guess I&apos;ll just listen to some sales pitch, say no, and get over with it… at least with his "Internet business" thingy.

May all of you reading this be showered with love.{%- endmark %}
