Hah… curse my procrastination habit… now I&apos;m totally beat. After hours of facing a radiation source and 3000 words and only an hour of sleep… *heads fall on the keyboard* Great… it isn&apos;t fun… (Darn bad habits are so hard to fix)

Anyway, I just *managed* to piece everything together for our Malaysian Studies assignment, which the topic is about "National Integration: Challenges and Steps Taken by the Government". And to top it off, I had our proposal for our Multimedia Technology project to be handed up on the same day! (heads spinning) So I guess you can imagine how exhausted right now.

But now, I don&apos;t think I can sleep today, I got my numerical analysis tutorials to be handed up tomorrow (Heh, my mom and most people would have told me "Serves you RIGHT!", which is totally true and I do deserve to be nagged and yelled) :( But while you are nagging, hope you don&apos;t mind me dozing off. I&apos;m just too tired to feel guilty now…

Darn! I got a worm in my computer! Shit, this is the first time I ever slacked my security checks >_<. Thank god I still have my antivirus guarding my system… but I do hope that it didn&apos;t do much damage.
