{% mark post -%}Got one e-mail today from my professor today regarding a spoilt digital pen which is previously given to me… And apparently it&apos;s my mistake that I used a wrong charger for the pen causing it to malfunction. His e-mail only stated the facts and nothing else, telling us that we should use the designated charger, no blaming, no name calling what-so-ever. But I can&apos;t stop but feeling really guilty about it, and depression just sets in out of nowhere, then stress, helplessness, escapism… all sorts of negative energy is flowing inside me to a point that I feel like killing myself.

Gah! Did took myself some time to pull myself together, but I still feel guilty and responsible for that. Not to mention the stress that I&apos;m experiencing now (assignments aaaaaaah!)… I think I can use a warm embrace, but it seems I&apos;m still alone here. Sigh…{%- endmark %}
