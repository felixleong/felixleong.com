{% mark post -%}For the past two-three days, I have been sitting in front of my computer with Macromedia Flash toolbox showing on screen. It had been quite a while that I have actually done any serious animating, and now I&apos;m pretty much rushing it because it seems that my evaluation copy of Macromedia Flash is going to expire in 3 days (Although I had downloaded a trail for the older version of Flash MX, just in case).

Anyway, bouncing back, as I initially thought having segmenting out the character is tough, wait till you tried the actual animating! Wow! I never knew it&apos;s THAT tough! Animating is pretty much easy, but to make it look natural is another, and it does take a long time to fine tune it to achieve the acceptable results (and it&apos;s not near from being the exact optimal results that you had in mind!). I have almost spent hours just to make a two second dance movement looked natural! Imagine that!

But thankfully Para Para is pretty much repetitive in nature so once I get the movements right, then animating will be as easy as reusing those repeating parts. Hopefully I can manage to finish in a few days time since I do need some quality time to catch up with my readings.

On an unrelated note, for some reasons or the other, one of the boardies is starting to get on my nerves. (not RPGamer, thank god. But the other one that I participated) As much I can be really tolerant and tend to let things be, I just can&apos;t stop but feeling the fumes inside and I can&apos;t seem to vent it out. Just wonder why I can&apos;t stop but focusing his post with no real and sometimes deceiving or idiotic content, being too opinionated, acting like a smart alec (that does brings memories during those RPGamers time when Seraphic made one comment to Deshy about that. It&apos;s kind of funny recalling that ^_^), and being rude and inconsiderate at times. OK, maybe I&apos;m really exaggerating things, but I can&apos;t help but magnify the negative aspects.

But what make it worse is that his English can be so broken that I can&apos;t stand it! OK, I don&apos;t really blame him for that because I know most Malaysian can&apos;t converse well in English (i.e. English being a foreign language), and I confess that my English is not really that good to berate anyone. But combined with my negative perceptions towards him does make it more annoying. FUDGE!!! <|-- stolen from Mary Alice regarding LDS-styled cuss words ^_^"

[*note: At this point, I&apos;m sure most PPStagers might have had a good guess who that was, but just let it be. I&apos;m just feeling all fumed up and it&apos;s pretty much emotional that I can&apos;t think objectively. If in any case that I had offended anyone (including the person whom is mentioned and unnamed), I&apos;m terribly sorry.]

Phew! Guess I&apos;m back to work! ^_^{%- endmark %}
