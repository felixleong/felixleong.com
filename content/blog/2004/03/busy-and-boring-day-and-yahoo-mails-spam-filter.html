Today&apos;s just another day with me sitting in front of the computer doing programming work, shootâ€¦ sometime I just wonder when I&apos;m able to be grouped with people who can produce better assignment work so that I just don&apos;t need to do a lot of editing before handing it out. Or perhaps is there any way that I&apos;m able to teach them how to do it in a better manner?

Anyway, yesterday I was striked a little bit odd because the "This is Spam" link has suddenly disappeared, which I use it all the time to report all the junk mail (and in effect, I get less spam, which is a good thing). And logging in today, I finally noticed the "Spam" button just next to "Forward" button!

Ah! Joy!
