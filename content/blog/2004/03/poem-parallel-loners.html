<b><u>Parallel Loners</u></b>
Every time I close my eyes
I see you… hurt…
Ever since when we are walking in parallel?
And why the distance between us is always far apart?
Every time I see you
You act like nothing happened
But deep down I still can sense
The bleeding in your heart

How many times when I close my eyes
I saw you hurt?
Ever since when we declare as friends
But never ever being close like one?
How many times I see you
I was holding back from calling you?
Perhaps I might be losing hope for many failed attempts
To get your attention

Every time I close my eyes
I see you… fading…
Ever since when my memories about ourselves are dissolving
And my feelings towards you are vanishing?
Every time I see you
You are getting further away from me
But deep down I can still sense
The bleeding in your heart

Sometimes… I&apos;m afraid…
That I&apos;m unable to see you again
Since the day we had gone separate ways
And I never ever left my eyes off you
Sometimes when I&apos;m able to see you
You seem to look worse than before
Perhaps I might be losing hope
Yet I hate to think that you&apos;ve fallen down while I can&apos;t see you from afar

Every time when I close my eyes…
I was seeing… you…
Ever since when I&apos;m hugging a pillow
And trying hard to retain a fading memory?
Every time I see you
You are getting smaller and smaller from my sight
But deep down I know…
I&apos;m holding a knife in my heart…
And I&apos;m bleeding…

[:: Random Thoughts ::]
- Why I kept feeling hopeless when I can&apos;t comfort someone in need? Is it that I was being shut out, or is it I didn&apos;t dare to ask, or is it my thoughts are so fragmented when I&apos;m feeling a strong emotion?
- Tomorrow&apos;s my ex-crush&apos;s birthday… … … As much as I know I&apos;ll give him a message, and my hurts are closing up… I&apos;m still feeling a little bit empty inside…

- May everyone who is feeling unloved/depressed be bless with love
- Paid my phone bills… phew… (Yeah… I know this is nonsense)
