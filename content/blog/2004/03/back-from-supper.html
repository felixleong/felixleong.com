Phew… just came back from supper with my friend. Guess what he&apos;s promoting? It&apos;s Amway!

Well… as much I understand how network marketing/direct sales goes (and knowing a little about good network marketing [like franchising] and bad ones [pyramid scheme]) and I accept it as a way to make money, personally I don&apos;t feel like it suits me well… considering that I prefer to face work (well… which pretty much encompass creative work) than people. (Or is it just a perception of myself that I believe that I am, which may or may not be real?)

And the funny thing that I made a bad decision of ordering coffee. If you haven&apos;t read my previous entry about coffee, I can&apos;t drink anything beyond mild coffee because I&apos;m too sensitive with them: Just anything slightly thicker would have made me all hyper, unfocused and horny. And worse, he&apos;s my ex-crush! Darn! I&apos;m in a total dilemma over there when I have that urging hormone rush and I wonder whether he noticed my "unnatural" behaviour and my fist-clenching and body twitching! :p

Before we left, he asked me a question "Who can drive cars?" Without any thought, I just answered "Anyone with a driving license." And he say that I&apos;m pretty much different from most others since most would have say "Only the rich drives them." Hmm… sometimes our perception towards things (in the case would be personal finance) can alter one response indirectly. :)

Till then… I just have to wait until the effect of caffeine fade away… DARN!!! >_<
