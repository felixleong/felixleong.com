{% mark post -%}- Tried the new 7-UP Ice, and it&apos;s basically still… 7-Up, perhaps except that it&apos;s a stronger 7-Up. The taste is much more stronger, and the pepermint flavour is boosted significantly, giving a cool kind of sensation of after taste, hence the "Ice" variety. The cool part is perhaps that the cool sensation stays for quite some time. Cool!

If you liked 7-Up a lot, you&apos;re going to adore this one. As much as I liked the milder 7-Up, the after taste is pretty much… well, cool. :) Best served chilled.

- During the time of writing, it&apos;s raining really heavily outside, together with rumbling thunderstorms. It rained so heavily that I had to close the windows in my room, although I do wish I can keep them open because of the cool fresh air.

- On a side-note, rain and being alone in my room does make me wish that someone special and cuddly is by my side. Just by the thought of it is enough to ignite my wildest imagination, with some of them made me flushing red like a big red tomato. Shoot… I hate having all the best things in fantasy land, guess I have to work hard to make them a reality.

- The 20-page report to be handed up on Monday noon, and I can stop but falling asleep by the materials that I have to research and read. m(T_T)"m

- Tweaking some parts of the Flash assignment and it&apos;s much closer to perfect now. That&apos;s a great achievement! The next thing is to code a song selection menu, if it gets done by tomorrow, it&apos;ll appear in my presentation, otherwise, I guess I just have omit it.

- Two more tests! Gyah! Gotta study hard this time.

- On a brighter note, I got a reply from my professor today, and it seems that it&apos;s not my digital pen that got spoilt. Phew… But at least I learnt a lesson today. (and I&apos;ll be getting my wages on Monday for helping him out in the research project. Woo hoo! My first ever paycheck! Although it&apos;s not a big amount though :p){%- endmark %}
