Hah, talk about maths. I always thought that they are all formula with no physical use.

But today, one of my friends came and ask me about using the linear interpolations and Newton-Rhapson methods. I&apos;m somewhat reluctant to refresh my memory (ugh… maths always gives me the headache), but I tried my best anyway. So we went on and on in trying to attempt and apply these methods for his theory of interest (the optional subject that I&apos;m not taking) problems.

After spending some time with nailing down the concepts in his brain (and mine as well), I suddenly find that there&apos;s practical use for these mathematical methods (although we only use it to estimate the interest rates) and those mathematical formula starts to make sense now.

Now I&apos;m glad to say that maths is really fun! (but wait until I do more maths problem, I can assure you that this feeling will wear off really soon!) XD
