As much as I believe astrology as one way to understand a person&apos;s personality, I never really trusted horoscopes. As much as Greeks (or is it someone else?) had spent centuries to study and figure out how the stars and planets affect a person&apos;s personality, I always wondered that does luck REALLY affected by the stars. I&apos;m like "Oh~ Come on! Grow up!" when it comes to horoscopes. It always seems to me that horoscopes are SO easy to fabricate: just have tons of advice or random events that are likely to happen and make them sounds as general and vague as possible, store them in a database or something, and just randomly pull out 12 of them everyday for every single sun sign. Oh, don&apos;t forget about putting random numbers and colour names and randomly select one and label them as "lucky colours and numbers".

Heh… you can&apos;t go wrong with that. Give it a try, read every SINGLE entry in the horoscope panel and see how many of them can be related to you and your current events. You will be surprise how "accurate" they can be, even though the true prediction is for Cancer while you are a Sagittarius, for example.

But then again, they are always fun, and I think I can have a place to store these junk and random advice in my head just to loosen myself a bit. Anyway, here&apos;s what&apos;s in store for me today according to Today&apos;s Horoscope in the papers:

"Given encouragement, a new relationship could soon achieve a romantic significance, if that&apos;s what you want for it. Now is the time to decide whether to advance or to draw back from a permanent commitment. Lucky colour black; lucky number 12"

Hah! Talk about good timing! And when I reached the second fullstop, my brains are already strolling away in fantasy land where I CAN be with every single hot guys and girls that I know. And everything over there is so flowery and SO perfect that the relationship does become too real to be true, not to mention that I can be with several of them at once without getting slapped or yelled. Oh~ And there&apos;s always a empty room for "special treats"… *drools, having skewed intentions…*

Then all of a sudden, I regained conciousness and I&apos;m sitting there on my bed. Then I gave myself a few slaps on the head for thinking… err, dirty. Picking the paper back up and when I read the third sentence, I was left with my brains… totally blank. As much as I do had strong feelings for a few "candidates", but for dream guys I personally feel that I&apos;m lusting them and for dream girls I was only thinking of knowing them a little bit better on the personal side.

*Sigh* Maybe I should get myself a boyfriend or girlfriend…

Two assignment dues for tomorrow… And I haven&apos;t even started with one! Gosh! Procrastination does get the better of me, I guess no sleep for me tonight.
