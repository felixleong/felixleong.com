{% mark post -%}Phew… Two months of hard work and almost two Flash trail expirations, I&apos;m almost done with my Flash assignment… Not really, but I finish the most time consuming parts of it and the next few days will be more focused to other works yet to be done. And the funniest thing is that I still can&apos;t manage to tone down the jiggly-ness of one dance move and I just can&apos;t stop laughing by the looks of it! (Wait until I posted up the assignment after the presentation and you&apos;ll know which part is it XD)

Other than that… it&apos;s pretty much a boring yet stressing day.
