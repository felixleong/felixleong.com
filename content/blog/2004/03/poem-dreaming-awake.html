{% mark post -%}<b><u>Dreaming Awake</u></b>
"Today is just another day,"
I said to myself just like every other day
Since when I hated to open my eyes
And continue with my dreamy state?

Countless time I had fallen
Yet countless time I&apos;m able to stand up
Since when I&apos;m afraid to fall down
Although the next pain is getting less painful every time?

I feel that I&apos;m living a lie
Where all my true self are in hides
Since when I have been ignoring the emptiness inside
And acted as if everything is fine?

Every time I wanted you to be my side
Yet every time you get closer I get further
Is it that I wanted to be that way?
Or is it that I&apos;m afraid to be hurt again?

Please tell me that you are a dream
But you&apos;re already standing in front of me
Is it that you&apos;re always too perfect?
Or is it just me who is shying away from everything?

Please wake me up from my dreamy state
But I&apos;m already wide awake
Is it that I&apos;m afraid of being hurt again?
Or is it that I&apos;m already getting used to the emptiness inside me?

Please wake me up from my dreamy state
But I&apos;m already wide awake
Since when… I feel that I have to live in my dreams?
Or is it that I have been shadowed by my own dreams…?

Please wake me up from my dreamy state
But I&apos;m already wide awake…

Inspiration came from Ayumi&apos;s ANGEL&apos;S SONG and some of my painful but beautiful past that I wish that I&apos;m able to bury away without regrets. I do wish I&apos;m able to be more realistic, but yet I&apos;m still living in my own dreamy state… Perhaps I should set my own priorities…

May all lonesome travellers of life be blessed.{%- endmark %}
