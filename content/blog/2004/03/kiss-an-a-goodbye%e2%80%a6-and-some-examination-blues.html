Just finished our Discrete Maths mid-term test… and I suppose I should kiss an A goodbye because I didn&apos;t do too well in this paper. But on the bright side of things, I have much more confidence with my answers in this test since I understand some of the concepts better than the previous one.

The final exams schedule has been posted up, and it&apos;s like… 3 weeks from now? I feel a little bit nervous since I do have a lot of catch up to do in order to get good grades. Oh well… As far as I&apos;m concerned, I&apos;m pretty much glad with my current assignment marks, especially the numerical analysis test which I have submitted a blank page for one question (out of two… o_o"), and I got full marks on the only question I have attempted. So far so good for one question.

Then… I found out that the crackles and pops are not caused by my CD ripper program but my sound card settings. XD Phew! So I can just rip CDs as usual. And yeah! MAX CD is so cool, and I like it a lot! (although their old Eurobeat covers is a little bit disappointing, but it&apos;s good nonetheless) And their non-stop CD features Don&apos;t You Want Me… and I have totally fell in love with Virginelle&apos;s original <3.

Ah! Babe! Don&apos;t Ya Want Me Tonite~ ^-^
