Heh heh, being naive is totally evil, nuff says.

OK, enough of my random quotes (err… I think I randomly made that up), but I decided to let my wildness lose a little and put my over-rationalizing nature into a cage. So… basically I took a new hobby for myself: I put myself in "hunting and flirty mode". It&apos;s not totally go all out or doing anything serious or extreme, I just loosen myself a little and try to look at who&apos;s hot and who&apos;s not in our class. That&apos;s pretty much a very welcoming and refreshing change considering the fact that I&apos;ve been either planting myself in work or my own ex-crush depression during the past.

And funny thing is that now I noticed hot guys (and a few girls) that I previously had overlooked in the past. Woo, kind of miss those increasing heartbeat sensation for quite a long time ;). Glancing back to my ex-crush, he&apos;s still hot, but I finally able to let my previous clinging go and enjoy such a good friend I had.

However the only problem is that now the flirty side of me started to invade some of my forums posts and IM chats, I&apos;m feeling like I&apos;m dropping hints to everyone now. Guess I better control myself a bit and don&apos;t create any unnecessary drama. :p (Or am I too late? Mua ha ha~)

Other than that, as long as I don&apos;t remind myself that there&apos;s assignment dues next Monday, it&apos;ll continue to be fun. (Darn! I did it again!) Better get back to school work!
