{% mark post -%}Got my friend to rip it for me, and apparently it&apos;s only my CD-ROM which didn&apos;t liked the CD and added the crackle, snaps and pops into the music.

In other news, I haven&apos;t been sleeping well just to finish up the 20-page report… which is unfinished by daybreak. o_O" Thinking that, I try to catch 3 hours to sleep before going to school for the quiz. And then I approached my lecturer and explained my situation, and luckily she gave me until tomorrow morning to hand it up. Phew… but I can&apos;t rest just yet and I need to complete the other 3000+ characters for the report.

Then it&apos;s the Flash assignment presentation week, our group are not presenting today since she picks groups on random, and apparently my group is almost the end of the queue. This translate to a possibility that we are only presenting our stuff next week. Well… perhaps I might just fix a few more loose ends during the weekends.

And for those eager to see it, as much as I believe you guys, I just can&apos;t put it up on public, just to be safe, hope you&apos;ll understand and wait until next week. I promise that I&apos;ll add in more features and stuff to compensate that ;). Cheers! (and which I don&apos;t get a nervous breakdown due to my lack of sleep, which will continue today){%- endmark %}
