- FUDGE! I have to finish the 20-page report by today! Shoot! Why I always delay the most important stuff till the last day (as much I do much reading before that)
- I have been called a tease XD. Hmm… maybe it&apos;s because I always speak in a much more indirect manner and I tend to hold back information some times, for the sake of keeping the surprise factor. This has keep many people (including my parents) into much unneeded suspense (whether good or bad), and people have been telling me that I always beat around the bush on certain things. Hmm… Maybe it&apos;s a bad thing?
- My snail mail reached their destination safely! Congrats!

OH MY GOD!!! THE 20-PAGE REPORT!!! *panic*
