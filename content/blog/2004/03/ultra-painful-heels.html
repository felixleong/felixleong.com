As much as most of my friends hated to wear anything which is associated with formal dress code, I personally find myself liking it for that professional image that projects. I guess it&apos;s pretty much due to the fact that the shirt can really make you sweat during the day (considering I&apos;m living in Malaysia which as a tropical climate all day round) and the slacks are so floppy that you feel like you are wearing either something or nothing at all. But I didn&apos;t really cared much about it because I can tolerate heat (but not cold) and I didn&apos;t really cared about the slacks (I do find jeans more comfortable though).

However, there&apos;s one thing I always hated about wearing anything formal: Leather shoes! I wonder since when leather shoes are used instead of something like cotton or something softer, so every time when I&apos;m walking with it I always feel the stiffness of the shoe and I&apos;m feeling like I&apos;m wearing high heels. And not to mention that the shoe is ankle high and the leather is stiff, more often than not the shoe will always hit my ankle while I&apos;m putting my leg down to the floor (and you can imagine me going "ouch~ ouch~ ouch~" all the way). And after long periods of walking, it&apos;s the heels which feel the strain and the pain isn&apos;t funny.

Blahâ€¦ maybe I should get another pair which uses softer leather.
