Argh! Suddenly the lecturers throws in two more stuff in my "in-tray"! (NOOOOO!!!) Gyah~~~

Turning back the time dial, this morning didn&apos;t start up well when I saw my aunt&apos;s note stuck to my door saying that the keys of the back door has been missing. For your information, she had been away during the weekends and during those home-alone times I was supposed to keep the door locked and switching on all the lights during the night. And apparently one of the keys has been lost during the process, which is pretty normal to me due to my forgetfulness.

So I just go on with a key search. As much as I&apos;m forgetful, I always have the habit to put it somewhere visible, or just the typical "convenient-spot-to-leave-your-things-on": You know, something like the tabletop where the newspapers is or on top of the fridge (apparently you know that I got distracted and forgets about the key that I left on top of it).

But I spent half an hour just to look for the keys at the most obvious places and I can&apos;t seem to find them at any of those obvious places. Just before I&apos;m at a point of giving up and finding an excuse, I saw it being stuck into the keyhole of the storeroom. Funny that I didn&apos;t thought of that because the handy man has to fix a burst pipe in there.

Heh… that remind me of the "What tarot card are you?" quiz that I had took months ago: <i>he best approach to a problem is not always the most obvious… The irony is that by making these contradictory moves, we find what we are looking for.</i> Life&apos;s pretty unpredictable.

Back to work now! (and I think I have to allocate some time for tomorrow&apos;s math test)
