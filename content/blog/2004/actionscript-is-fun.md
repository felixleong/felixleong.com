title: Actionscript Is Fun

As I was in my depressed mood, I have been lazing around, feeling like doing nothing (especially the 20-page report which I need to hand up this Monday). I do wonder why people can get so unproductive when encountered with negative moods and stress.

Then looking at my almost finished Flash assignment, a kind of urge to complete it arises and pretty much unwillingly, I blast Flash MX on my computer and continue to add some nifty features into it. One of the features that I wanted to put in is the reverse viewing mode, and it did looked tough at first since I NEVER tried ActionScript before. After some tutorials fumbling, I tried to digest as much as I could.

But after a while, I noticed that it isn't that hard considering it's only one line of code: `setProperty("", _xscale, "-100");`. So that was the easy part, the tougher part is to implement the button to switch the viewing mode, and it was suppose to flip everything except for the titles! And AUGH! That was tough (well… at least during the time when I had no idea how the codes works)! Took me quite a while to test with various parameters in order to make it work… well, it still had some quirks, but it's nothing major (you'll know once I get the file up for downloading, which is after my presentation ^-^).

Fixed a few more disjointed animation parts, some part still looked a bit unnatural, as much I would say it was acceptable. And… duh! It's almost 4 in the morning! Gotta catch some sleep!
