Cut so that poor dialup users don't have to suffer that over 100k image download ^^".

Anyway, I'm not sure whether this cover design is going to get through (well… if they say no I have to design another one ^^"), but it took me quite some time to come up with this and I'm extremely proud of it ^^.

Currently at work… kinda tired actually due to lack of sleep, yet I still have to work *dies*. See you guys later then!
