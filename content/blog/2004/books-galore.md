Hmm… let's see… trying to avoid the building stress, I decided to get to [Acmabooks](http://www.acmabooks.com/) (a Malaysian online bookstore) and have a few clicks to check some new books. There's quite some interesting reads which I dump into my wishlist… (Augh! Now I remembered that I didn't check whether there's Marry Poppins! XD I'm into some classics and adaptions lately.)

Then I just checkout two graphic design books and Harry Potter: The Order of Phoenix (Finally I can get my hands on it), I don't think I can wait for the paperback, and besides… the prices difference might not be high after all those discounts and stuff which is going around here. My VISA Electron finally do some justice today and I think that's the only online merchant which accepts them, thank god. Guess the Internet is a good place afterall. (As long as I'm alert on what I'm doing… can risk having my bank account belly up)

What else… Yeah! The Penang trip! Gosh I never knew that they have BIG plans to get it running, which totally out of the planet (compared to my expectations). And in case there's enough people during the gathering, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NATIONWIDE PRESS CONFERENCE! Oh jolly! (Of course, **we don't have enough members going…** but it's a nice thought though :p) Spread the Palapala around~ :p

Augh! I'm wasting my time again. ~~Gotta hit the books again!~~ Prepare for battle in an hour's time. (I typed most part of it yesterday XD)
