title: Rambling Of The Day: Being a Burden To Someone Else

Darn! Sometimes I just hate myself X(. You know, being absent-minded, have absolutely no sense of direction (especially when it's a car), getting all frustrated over things which is beyond my control, and having a totally fragmented brain when I get panicked or guilty over something. I just hate my own shortcomings.

**Longer story:** (Which is pretty much fragmented which reflects my current thoughts X( )

Went to Time Square with a friend today, then we go separate ways due to the fact that we are going to do different stuff. Have fun in the arcades, but didn't notice that my network has no coverage in my phone and my phone ran out of juice later on. Went home alone since I can't get through his cell using a public phone, and on my way back home, I happen to stumble upon Jacob and have dinner and chat pretty long with him.

Pluggin' in my phone, my friend seems to be really worried since he had sent tons of messages. Then I called him back, and he said that he'll come over with a few friends (one of them wants to return some books back), then they ask me whether there's a place nearby which sells porridge (one of them is sick), and I said that there might be one, but I'm not sure whether it's open. They said "Hop on!", which I did, but I should have trust my instincts that I KNEW the roads over that area is SO badly planned that I have no idea how to get there without me shuffling through my fragmented thoughts (since I'm still feeling guilty and panicked there). Gave out some really bad directions and ending up having them dropping me back home with all of them feeling frustrated.

Ah crap! I can't even make sense of what I'm rambling up there! *dies*

That's perhaps why I prefer to do pretty much everything on my own, at least I don't have to worry about others. But then again, I don't want to do everything alone ;\_;… I really wished that some people is willing to go shopping with someone who always tends to get lost (read: me), I really wished to go to the book stores with a friend who doesn't mind to spare hours just to be in there (I know most of them won't), I really wished that someone will accompany me to have lunch and dinner together, I really wished that I can have someone to share the burden together, I really wished that it's OK to have fragmented thoughts and speech… T-T

By far, I think I did have those great friends, but now every one of them seems so far away from me… I really wanted a close friend now… someone who is able to accept who I am and vice versa… (for some reason, Choon Hui pops up in mind… but then again… ;\_;).

OK… that did relieve some of my frustrations. Anyway, day 2 is pretty much… OK, nothing happened except that I forgot that no one is going to switch on the lights at night. Thank god I manage to get back home at 8pm. A few more school stuff is due tomorrow, which did add on to my frustrations…

Crap… I just wish that I can take things easy and calmly…
