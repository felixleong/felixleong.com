Just for the stress relief, here's something for your reading pleasure:

### Helpless: A Cry For Help

As if planets are revolving around me  
It seems like everything around me is twirling  
As I close my eyes and hope that this will stop  
It didn't  
Everything is swirling inside as well

Every time when people ask me how do I do  
I just answered that I've been juggling with too much work  
As I tried to let them go and hope that this will stop  
It didn't  
It's seems that I'm the one being juggled

As if the force of gravity has increase its strength  
It seems that I can barely walk with my legs planted on the ground  
As I tried to sit down and hope that I can rest  
It didn't  
Everything around me is forcing me to go on

Every time when people ask me how do I do?  
I just smiled… say everything is OK  
As I close my eyes and hope chaos will stop  
It didn't  
A silent cry of help is amplifying deep inside…

As if I have become someone with a sealed mouth  
It seems that my feelings aren't able to be voiced out  
As I close my eyes and pray that someone can listen to my little voice  
Crying for help  
… Did it? Or it didn't?

I did notice that my poem structure and style didn't changed much until now… Hmm… I wonder is it a good thing? :p
