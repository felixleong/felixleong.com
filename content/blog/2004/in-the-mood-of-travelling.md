Today I just accompany my aunt to go to the airport, since granny have to go to Singapore today and we have to accompany her since she's can't really walk well. Well, she's not my real granny, she's actually a cook for my late uncle previously and now my aunt is taking care of her. Now she has to go to Singapore for a few days to be with her relatives, so I'll be quite lonely at home these days.

Anyway, while I'm in the airport, I was thinking of travelling! :) Thinking about it, I would really want to expand my horizons and go out and see and experience things for myself. And it's kind of neat to know some of the boardies that I have been chatting to :).

But then again, *opens up wallet and see moths fly* Sigh, looks like I'm going to be stranded in Malaysia for quite some time. Anyway, I'm planning to travel around once my holidays starts :). At least I got a head start of things :). Hopefully I can visit Japan and the US soon after. Dream on, Felix! :D

Hmm, my quiz results. Kind of true, but I'm not sure. I can't see what people see of me :).
