Ever had one of those days when you feel suddenly lose your confidence on whether your actions are right or wrong, even though the things that you are concerned is pretty much trivial? Well… that pretty much sums up what I feel today.

Incidently, my touchstone card of the day is the Heirophant in reverse. Hmm…

Anyway, I decided to stay home today to catch up on stuff I left behind.
