Great… now I had the sneezes… I'm always prone to these sickness that is related to cold whether. I wonder whether I should blame my genes, the amount of fat under my skin, or my own immune system. (Or perhaps my tendency to forget to take my daily dose of Vitamin C?)

As it turns out, I'm skipping today's lecture classes so that I can stay at home and continue with my Flash assignment with some peace and quiet. And as it turns out… I made one decision mistake and the character dance template doesn't seem to work well with the actual animation. However, with tons of character models being made, I guess I have to just continue with my work instead of fixing every single one of them. It's workable, but the animation will not look that nice in the end and timing can be quite a chore.

By all hopes, I wish that I can finish this assignment by this week and get over with it. But luckily I had finished almost one-third of it.
