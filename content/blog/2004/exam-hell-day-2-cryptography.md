2 down, 4 to go!

Just a quicky:
- ARGH! I never expect this to be more of a memorization paper than a calculation one X(. And I REALLY HATE to memorize mathematical proofs! (Guess what came out in our exams, eh?)

    Should have trust my general mistrust to examination tips and guidelines.

    And so The Study of Tales from the Crypt (stolen from shinobisword, yay for me forgetting the lj-user tag XD) is closed starting from today.

- Got Memorial Address (with DVD <3) yesterday, which means that I just need Duty and A Song for XX to complete my ayu's album collection. I got D&D's LOVE IS A MELODY as well from Tower Records, and god I love the rendition of IN YOUR EYES (A cover of Karen's Nothing Gonna Take My Love… I forgot the actual song name :p)… as much as I would say that cover was not really creative :p.
- Found out that the Ayumi Hamasaki Complete Clip Box Set I bought the other day is a bootleg >.<". DAMN PIRATES! (they even have the avex logo on it ;\_;… I only knew when I look at the back of the CD, which doesn't have the usual avex printed barcodes and stuff). So… Be extra careful guys!
- Suddenly I just have the kicks in playing the song dedication game :).
- My notebook isn't back yet ;\_\_\_; (Meaning that I won't be online that much than what I'm used to… which is a good thing considering the exams I'm having now :p)
OK, gotta scoot now! Next up: Entrepreneurial Skills and Business Ethics tomorrow afternoon!
