Just finished two pixel arts to be included in my portfolio for the pixel artist job, I tried to make some mock game screens:

!['Star Trip: In Game Screen'](http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/portfolio/ingame.png){: .img-responsive}

Hmm… if they are an actual game, would you buy it? XD (Notice that the screen is vertical, since I'm applying for the pixel artist job for a mobile phone game company)

In other news, in my time zone today, khaki\_29uk is celebrating his birthday. Happy birthday!!! *throws confetti and pop some party poppers*
