Today… as usual… I'm late for school… again (blah blah blah… I don't think I want to get into that crap again)

It's been quite a while since I haven't been on IM lately, originally I was thinking that the school has been outsmarting my proxy-tunnelling efforts to get into IM (for those technologically-challenged, basically that means that I use a software to connect to IM services which has been originally blocked by the school server. This can be done by having the software to act as a "tunnel"/middle-man to secretly pass those messages through. Think of it as good CIA or KGB spies).

But after a check at [HTTPort's](http://www.htthost.com/) (the proxy tunnelling software) site, looks like there's some technical problems causing the downtime. So… Well… guess no IM at school for a few more days.

As school continues, it seems that the future workload during my course is going to really heavy and intimidating. My database subject requires us to find a third party who might benefit from a system and we are expected to have some interviews and presentations. Just by the thought of it sounds scary. Hopefully I can manage this, my self-confidence is pretty much shaky right now.

On the other hand, for my multimedia technology subject, we are require to create a Flash movie. It does sounds a lot of fun, currently I'm thinking of ideas between my own anime trailer and a Para Para animated Flash movie! ^\_^ I might be doing the latter, it would really be cool when I show it to others :D.

Well… so much for another day at school. Currently I'm just feeling a little bit annoyed by the fact that sometimes people will only call you "friends" when there are some form of benefits in store for them. As much as I accept that and didn't take it too personally, when this happens I can't help but feeling something fuming deep inside me…
