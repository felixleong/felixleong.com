Going to the bookstore with Choon Hui is definitely priceless <333. *^-^* I'll just leave it as that (Refer to yesterday's thread for that one). Got myself a few more books, which includes **another** book on Japanese. Gosh with all those books I wonder why I still haven't get a good grasp of the language XDDD. *(the voice inside: Take the time to READ them)*

In other news, I won the auction for ayu-ro CD <333, Paypal have already charged my debit card… so I guess I just have to wait until the CD shipped to me. (Hope it'll be soon)

Well… I think I got too full with Choon Hui now. Perhaps I might need some time to digest it. Now I just need to make sure I keep tabs with my obsessiveness or else it might drag me to another dark void of depression.
