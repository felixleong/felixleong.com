Just finished our Discrete Maths mid-term test… and I suppose I should kiss an A goodbye because I didn't do too well in this paper. But on the bright side of things, I have much more confidence with my answers in this test since I understand some of the concepts better than the previous one.

The final exams schedule has been posted up, and it's like… 3 weeks from now? I feel a little bit nervous since I do have a lot of catch up to do in order to get good grades. Oh well… As far as I'm concerned, I'm pretty much glad with my current assignment marks, especially the numerical analysis test which I have submitted a blank page for one question (out of two… o\_o"), and I got full marks on the only question I have attempted. So far so good for one question.

Then… I found out that the crackles and pops are not caused by my CD ripper program but my sound card settings. XD Phew! So I can just rip CDs as usual. And yeah! MAX CD is so cool, and I like it a lot! (although their old Eurobeat covers is a little bit disappointing, but it's good nonetheless) And their non-stop CD features Don't You Want Me… and I have totally fell in love with Virginelle's original <3.

Ah! Babe! Don't Ya Want Me Tonite~ ^-^
