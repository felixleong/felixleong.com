Just some recap of past events:

- Just finished my numerical analysis computer programming assignment, now what I need is to run a few tests, debug, and I'm done with it :3
- Been chatting with Johnson just now, and he pretty much talked about work related stuff. But somehow we drift into some deep philosophical thoughts that really interest me. I'm keep them in my head for Today's Drifting Thought ideas :p.

As a footnote, I'm not going to touch any real alcoholic drinks anymore (unless on special occasions), since I have pretty much 101% sure that I definitely can't stand even less than one glass of beer to get drunk (at least physically). Honestly with my sensitivity/allergies with most thing with an -ol appended at the back of it, make it alcoholic drinks or perfume, I suppose it doesn't came to me as a big surprise.

But then again… I still love my shandy (Less than 1% alcohol) and wine chocolates though. Talk about double standards here :p. Anyway, just wish someone would understand what I'm trying to say here ;).

Anyway, it's getting late now and I have class in the morning tomorrow. So *yawn* 　おやすみなさい！＾＾　(Heh… putting what I learned in my Japanese class into action :p)
