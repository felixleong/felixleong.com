**Scene:** A tired Felix sitting in front of the computer, while enjoying his fair share of sushi ^^. Yum!

**Thoughts:** Fleeting thoughts… revolving a sense of sorrow, yet the sorrow seems so beautiful, seemingly to cherish every small things in life…

**Work:** Nothing less of a roller-coaster ride itself. But at least my reading list doesn't get piled up lately.

**School:** The usual: ASSIGNMENTS!!!! *screams and run around in circles* Japanese class tomorrow, it'll be greetings this week ^^.

**Internet-Related Event:** If there's no accident, you can catch me on MSN during work. Of course, don't type too much that my boss might feel suspicious ^^". And secondly, Erika's (sayinmango) having a LiveJournal *^^*.

**Family:** Will be going back to my parents' next Saturday <333.
