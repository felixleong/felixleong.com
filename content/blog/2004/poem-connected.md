### Connected

It seems like we are living in two dimensions  
Where you and I are never destined to be together  
Yet sometimes life is often unpredictable  
I noticed you through a flux of void

There, I saw you  
Vague as it seems, it seems so real  
Through that window you seemed so close  
I thought you were here

Happy time we had together  
I never knew that I'm able to find someone  
Who I feel destined to be with me  
Yet hopes can be fragile

Reality strikes  
The void has disappeared  
And you are never to be seen… again  
And I was left there…. waiting

Through times I was hurt  
Again and again  
Still clinging on  
Yet I never knew that we are not destined to meet

Is it that what brought us together to be blamed?  
Or is it consequences of the futures cannot be known?  
Puzzled as it seems  
I'm still clinging on… feeling hurt…

I still believe  
There's somewhere where I can find you  
And I'm constantly searching for it  
And if only I can find that connection…

Why it seems when you are not there  
I noticed that I can't live without you  
I wanted to be connected with you  
Yet I'm still searching… for you

Inspired by Ayumi's song with the same name, and a few ideas I had developed about relationships.

May all people in love be blessed.
