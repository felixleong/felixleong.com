Yup… exams are closing in such a wild pace that I'm almost totally unprepared for it o\_o". I can feel it breathing over my shoulder, and even worse: I'm KNOW that I'm totally unprepared yet I'm STILL NOT FEELING NERVOUS OR ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE ME READ!!! Augh! So far so good for my self-discipline…

Anyway, been on the computer today, my dialup need to topup today yet the online banking service is temporarily down. Grr… How annoying. Well… since I still have enough funds in my Internet account to allow me to surf for another 2 hours or so, I guess I can wait for a while. But damn! I just hate going to the mall and pay bills! (in case I'm using up the prepaid value in my account before I'm able to pay it online)

Out of the blue I have been watching Ahmed's Randomness @ Kam's video… a lot. I don't know, They are just a bunch of antics, it's just fun sitting and watching them having fun. (*cough* I wonder whether Ahmed ever play Kirby before, the beginning of it just reminds me of Kirby XD) And for some reasons… it's just… heartwarming, something genuine that I can't seem to explain. Maybe I'm just feeling a little jealous over here :p.

In other news, it's kind of fun seeing some good boardies came back and show up on [RPGamer](http://board.rpgamer.com/), the Misc. section is still getting pretty slow and spam is still there (although it has decreased by a large margin lately)… Just looking forward for some new stuff there. ^-^ (speaking of which, I can't believe I'm slacking on making tutorials on Fanart! Gah! I guess I can put in some time and effort once my exams end)

[:: Random Stuff ::]

New sig! I combined three different styles in one this time: Anime (the image), abstract (the background) and pixel art (my name) into one. Looks a bit strange, but I kind of liked it :p.
