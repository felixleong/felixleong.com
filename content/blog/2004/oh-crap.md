Just when I decided to go to the gathering and see who was the surprise visitor that Tommy had mentioned yesterday, God decided to give me a heavy downpour and leave me at home doing Powerpoints instead. ;\_; But then again, those are REALLY important Powerpoints since I need them for my presentation on Tuesday and realistically I should be staying at home and do everything which is important first.

Well… I don't know, but I do know that I have that notorious habit to forget about priorities and do whatever which interest me the most instead of doing anything which is more urgent or important. Well… at least the rain has dampen my itch to know what the surprise is… Guess I have to skip the gathering and ask Tommy about it later at night. -\_-" (Hope it is not one of those once in a lifetime kind of thing… like someone who is influenced enough to let us have a public performance or something)

What else… yeah, Powerpoints. Well… apparently for the time being I'm a little bit too overwhelmed by other school work that I'm too lazy to do my own research any more. So I'm like searching online and getting some key points here and there and elaborate my ideas based on the stuff that I have found. I don't know whether this counts as plagiarism? Hmm… I better try to read some more material and sprinkle some original content here and there.

For some reasons… I just find myself being lethargic and sleepy these days. I suspect that my health has pretty much declined drastically since the frequent sneezes came back to me. I don't know whether I should attribute to the rainy season lately. Well… at least on the better side of things, I feel better emotionally and I have much more spirit in completing stuff. As much as I still feel a little bit deprived from some things (umm… especially my needs for some fuzzy feelings :p), I feel much more content with the things which I have now. I guess I can just put in more effort to make my life better.

[p/s: If it didn't rain, most probably this entry would have been titled "Oops I Did It Again!" :p ]
