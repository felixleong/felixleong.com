Nothing much except for the extreme urge to scream out of my lungs (read: assignments). Just to recap:

- Just got my haircut, and it turns out to be pretty good ^^
- The Lolita Try Me Album should be in the postal service now <333
- My Ayu-ro Mix CD hasn't arrived yet ;\_\_\_\_\_; (but then again, it's only a weekâ€¦ >.> And I'm sure that I put the correct address)
- Assignments ought to be shot

Guess that's about it.
