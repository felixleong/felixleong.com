I do hope that I'm not a perfectionist myself, but then again I really hate to see any thing to be handed up to the lecturer being least than perfect (by my standards anyway).

Other than that, today is just a hair pulling day >.<", no really. My hair is so annoyingly tangled up that I kept on messing around with it to make it less tangled… which didn't work >.<". I do wonder whether the air-conditioner is the culprit. And so it seems that I now look like a psycho with a bad hair day. Ugh….
