Just to make it short:

1. **1st Surprise:** If any one of you do enter my LJ through my page and not through your own Friends Page, I just changed my layout. Not fully, I'm still using LJ's defaults, but I'll be overriding some settings to make it look cooler and personalized. Stay tuned! (I'll do just that when I got bored out of my mind reading exam materials)
2. **2nd Surprise:** OMG! Tommy approached the owner who owns the small stage near a shop in TimeSquare (the mall where we usually gather) and the kind cafe owner allows us to use it… free of charge! Oh my god! Even this is going to last for one day, I'm already REALLY excited! Can't wait for Sunday to come <3!
3. **3rd Surprise:** Guess what! I found cheap hotels/guesthouses in Penang! If we manage to book one, then the trip is totally definite and on! Not to mention I'll have my first ever public performance *squeals* and a go on a LINKED PPP machine!!! ^^v Yay!
4. **4th Surprise:** Anyway, I can't seem to find a way to link to my friend's blog (since free accounts has so much restrictions that I can only modify the layout and nothing else. Well… Sorry, Aaron, this is the best I can do (which will only last for about a week before it goes to page 2):

    [Aaron Selvan's Blog](http://www.aaronselvan.com/blog/)

    (p/s to Aaron: Remove my link in case it's going to page 2, I don't really feel like posting a link every 20 entries, it gets REALLY tiring)

    (p/s to all friends: This is pretty much a tech blog, if technology stuff makes you sleep… make sure you know what you are clicking)

5. **5th Surprise:** Sleep deprivation all over again ;\_;, gotta hit the books now!
