My aunt came back yesterday night, which officially ended my home alone period. The wildest thing I ever done during this period: Filming videos outdoors XDDD. Darn I can't believe that I have become a good boy for a week (including waking up at 6 in the morning, which is almost an impossible feat for me)

Anyway, nothing much happened today, since I have *practically* being in my room typing codes for my assignments. Well, it's some good learning experience though ^^. But then again, I got tons of assignments lined up… .\_."

Dom said that her mom sent my package, wee~ Hope I get it within this week or so =3, then I'll be the proud owner of Euromach 3.

Now what I need now is obedience classes for my aunt's dog, he'd NEVER stop barking at almost everything that moves! >.<"
