God! I think I had overworked my legs yesterday and I ended up with a painful knee joint today X(. Now I'm almost limping over to school, giving out some occasional groans of agony, and constantly giving myself a painful massage (at least it works in relieving some of the pain).

My friend is offering to take me to a clinic afterwards (Darn I had to break the bank againâ€¦), thank god. Hopefully it isn't something serious (I might update you guys later). Till then, I guess I have to have a lot of rest.
