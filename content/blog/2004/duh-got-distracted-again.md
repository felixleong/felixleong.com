While doing my assignment, I got kinda bored so I drew stuff to be sent to my pen pal (Well… actually I was *requested* to do so for some reasons :p). I was only requested to do one sketch, and while I'm at it… I guess I get too engrossed and I ended up doing a pencil artwork instead XD:

Basically I had the idea for these characters for 6 years which I'm planning to develop a 12-chapter novel/game/comic, but I never had time to develop it fully so the only thing I had is sketches and strings of fragmented ideas.

Well… at least I got myself a new wallpaper.
