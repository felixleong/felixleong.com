Today is pretty much exciting: it's MYPPF (our Para Para community, Malaysian Para Para Fantasy) second gathering, featuring Cubex! His arrival is a special one because he's one of the active members from East Malaysia, which is across an ocean from us. So I just put aside my current assignments and go out and expecting a perfectly fun day.

However, things didn't turn out as it should.

On my way to Time Square, apparently I was distracted by those political party campaign posters and I was almost run over by a motorcycle while a cross one of the widest roads. That shocking encounter has already put me in quite a shock that didn't seem to calm down, and along the way I'm feeling down for blaming myself of being absent-minded. A Slurpee did help to relieve my stress, but still I can't seem to calm down or erase that memory from my head.

Then in the arcades, I tried Xiao Ying's idea of playing PPP **blind-folded** and that was really an experience to me. It's tougher than playing total invisible mode (i.e. invisible arrows and characters) since I'm literally playing blind and I have to guess my current position from the stage (And the peep hole below doesn't help a bit!). And during the game, I suspected that I hit somebody, nearly falling off a stage, and having a little cramp over my legs. God! That's tough. However when I remove my blind-fold, I saw one kid crying just next to me, although my friends tell me I didn't do anything to him, that does drag my emotions down even more.

But bouncing back to the highlights, Cubex did show up at 3p.m.! :D Woo-hoo! He's wearing a yellow baseball cap with "cubex" embroidered on the lower-right corner. As much as he looks cool, his body is cute and slightly chubby… and he dance really stylishly on Pump It Up! Cool! Too bad I can't strike a conversation with him… he's good eye candy to me ^\_^.

Reaching home, my body sores all over due to my lack of exercise during the past few weeks of assignment rush. Ouch… Anyway, hopefully my assignment rush tonight will distract me and make the shock go away… Looks like I do want to have some hot chocolate to go with it…

[::Random Thought::]

- Is there any cure for absent-mindedness? :(
