Well, not really. My CDRom hates the first track (Body feels EXIT) a lot, making me unable to listen nor rip the track ;\_;… not to mention the CDRom cause two minor scratches on the CD. NOOOOOOO~~~!!! >.<"

The next best alternative is either my desktop which runs on Linux (but I can't rip it there), or the included player in the CD. (which has better 128Kbps encoded songs, compared to many avex CCCD I owned) But the other tracks just happily reside on my notebook now, so I guess I have to ask a friend to help to get that track out.

Anyway, to my surprise, there are THREE Eurobeat covers in Namie's 181920: Try Me ~Watashi o Shinjite~ (Original by Lolita), Taiyou no SEASON (I don't know the original song) and Stop The Music (Original by Sophie). Try Me did got me a shock, I didn't like it during the first run XD. OK, obviously there's NO way anyone can mimic Eurobeat artists vocals, especially when it comes to Lolita's. But after listening to it a couple of times, it's a great song by it's own right ^^v. I definitely love Stop the Music, and she captured the same spirit as Sophie's original, making me instantly hooked. Now I found myself liking the cover and the original ^^. Out of curiosity, Namie's Stop The Music has somewhat arranged in the same way like how SEB100 sounds (and as most of you might have knew, SEB100 contains all songs mixed non-stop!). :p

The other tracks are pretty great as well, I personally liked Body feels EXIT and CAN YOU CELEBRATE? a lot (and my CDRom hates it ;\_;). A walk in the park is also great, the other tracks are pretty decent as well, not to mention that the music spans to a lot of different genres, making it one refreshing CD to listen to. I haven't tried the DVD included (I need a DVD player ;\_;), I suppose I might as well wait for a while. Too bad they don't have any PVs for ALL Eurobeat covers in the CD. How dare they! Darn avex! T-T

Anyway, one of my better friends have came to PJ from Sabah! Oh great! It's been a while I haven't seen him… the problem is that he's not free and he will be going back soon. Aww… shucks! On a side note, It's kinda embarrassing unable to identify his voice when he called me just now. Oh god…

Later on, I went to Time Square with some PPP fun. When I went there, it seems that there's an JGTC expo held over there, well… I'm not that into motor sports, but I suppose those who are can imagine all those cool cars displayed over there for people to drool on. And just before I head home, the JGTC race queens are taking photographs for the press… and OMG! Did I saw Ryoko and Tomomi there O\_O"? Well… I don't really believe my eyes, but there are two of those race queens who looked like them. "Tomomi" has the PPP1 hairstyle while "Ryoko" has the one like PPP4, but I don't really think it's them because that "Ryoko" looks a little bit younger while "Tomomi"'s eyes are pretty much… different. Maybe it's just me…

But then, if they ARE Ryoko and Tomomi… *stab self* ;\_;. Well… for one thing, I'm not too sure (sorry, no pics since I didn't have a camera with me >.<"). Perhaps I might as well check the papers tomorrow (hopefully there's a picture or two regarding the event). Err… perhaps they are Vivace? (But then again, I have NO idea how the Vivace members looked like either.
