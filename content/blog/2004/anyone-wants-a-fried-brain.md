Today I'm particularly in a really sunny mood: I'm totally bombarded by the amount of school work that I feel totally choked by it. I'm experiencing stress which makes me feel pressured, and I had no way to escape from it. The headache is getting so intense that even your friends' jokes had become an annoyance. At the time like this, I wish I can close myself in a silent, secluded space so that I have more room to breath and think. But then again, that was pretty much a luxury to me considering the fact I can't go too far from where I am now.

Sleeping on the desk (while having classes) does help to make the headache go away, but yet I still have my responsibilities to attend to. My school work is slowly torturing me, yet in order to attain my dreams, I need to conquer these problems instead of running away from it.

Darn… I do need a vacation… (but I can't have it :( )
