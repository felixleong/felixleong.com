OK, there's a big possibility that I REALLY saw Ryoko ;\_;.

[According to her official website](http://homepage3.nifty.com/RYOKO-ODAKURA/), she did mention her JGTC schedule… and there's one line on the front page saying: Ｃｌｕｂ　Ｆ撮影会お疲れ様でした。今週末はＧＴ選手権ｉｎセパンが行われます。 >> Babelfish Translation: It seemed the Club F photographing meeting tired way. This week end GT championship in Sepang is done.

NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! *stabs self endlessly* ;\_\_\_\_\_\_\_;
