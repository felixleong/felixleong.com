This is not the first time I heard this question…
This is not the first time I heard people questioning their own existence…
This is not the first time I heard people hoping that they would not exist…

I have been through all this at least once…
And yet I can't seem to comprehend the reason…

Why the despair?
Why the agony?
…Why?

They said that the beauty of life is of the freedom of choice of humans
And yet we just can't choose in our favourable form of existence…
But then again… how can we define what we like if we didn't born to exist…?
