Gahâ€¦ With some assignment due dates closing in with rapid speed, I have to force myself to keep my sleeping hours to a minimum in order to catch up with all the stuff that I had left behind. Therefore I foresee myself going to have puffy eyes REALLY soon, not to mention that I'll be living with love letters (a kind of Chinese cookie, not the real one which makes you all mushy :p) and perhaps some carbonated drinks (having PepsiX Energy Cola today) throughout the ordeal. And I'll be walking around like zombies and I'm sure I'm going to spend most of my classes sleeping or catching up with stuff.

Till hell ends, wish me luck that I didn't end up being zombified.
