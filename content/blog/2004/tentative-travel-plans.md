Wee~ I got a tentative travel plan within this year, let's see… I'm thinking of going to Penang possibly this May, and during the end of December I'm thinking of going to Singapore <3!

Speaking of going to Singapore, I might need a passport… but I still don't what procedures is required (I only knew that I need to get my document and blah blah blah to the immigration department or something… but the details are kind of fuzzy). Guess I'll ask my brother some time later (since he's studying in UTM, Johor, which is only a shore apart from Singapore).

But just to come back to my present situation, mid-term exams and some assignment proposals need to be done. So I need to work hard for it :).

[::Random Thoughts::]

Ever since yesterday I got that travelling lust, I'm constant dreaming that I got air tickets to the US and I'm announcing the boards saying "Felix coming to the States! <3 and trying to schedule plans to visit some of the boardies. Sounds fun, although it's still kind of distant :). Hopefully I can get my dream come true!
