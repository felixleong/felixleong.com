PHEW~ Finally I managed to finish my assignments and handed it up on time. What a relief!

But because of that, I haven't been sleeping since 10 yesterday… it's pretty funny since I usually can't do without at least 8 hours of sleep. (Although I do feel like sleeping now, but I can't) Perhaps it's either the job responsibility, or… well, God bless :).

Anyway, I'm now able to live normally, but perhaps not for long since my mid-term exams are coming up really soon and there are other assignments for me to settle with. Till then, let me just enjoy a peaceful day without any worries.

Oh… by the way, I'm totally drenched now due to the fact it's raining really heavily on my way home. Worse still is that I'm totally barehanded! Just took a shower just now… hopefully I don't get sick :).
