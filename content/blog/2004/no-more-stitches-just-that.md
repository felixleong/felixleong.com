*"At least I don't have to worry that the next accident will be 'I banged into the glass door of my own room again'."*

Stitches removed! The good news, no more really annoying itches around the wound (it still itches, but not to a very annoying degree). Bad news? There's still gapping in my wound, which means that my medication bill will not end just yet >.<". I think I really better contact my insurance agent to make sure I had everything I need to claim the money back. >.>

Bought a hair brush yesterday, so now at least the tangle wasn't of a big problem… at least for now. We'll see how it turns out later.

And yeah, life has been pretty unhappening right now, which is a good thing since I have to do my revision.

**Countdown to exams:** 9 days
