I have been coughing, sneezing and suffering from a flaring sore throat today, all because of allergies! Anyway, I have to mention what happen yesterday: Yesterday while I was still having fun at the gathering, my aunt is really annoyed by the amount of mosquitoes in my room and decided to use one of those insect sprays in my room. However, unknown to her, I'm allergic to them (in fact I'm almost allergic to anything that involves in spray cans). So I ended up sleeping in my room with agents that causes my allergies.

And when I wake in the morning today, my throat is like burning, and I was like sneezing like no end. Although I got my sneezing under control during the afternoon, I got a running nose instead. So I was like meeting up with Tommy in the arcades in a pretty sick state (which I suspect that they didn't notice since my sore throat haven't affected my voice).

On the brighter side of things, I finally got a new pair of running shoes for cheap (RM30, which is about US$8) and I need not worry that I get water in my shoes again. Other than that… I feel really sick today…

Random thought of the day: I have been thinking about the sexuality issue today, and I got some interesting thoughts on that. However, I'm not feeling that well today, so guess I leave that for another time.
