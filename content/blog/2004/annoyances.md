How many time that I just try to act cool and reasonable while some annoying people is yapping on my back, trying to ask me to do stuff, giving completely idiotic responses or conversations… or just be totally noisy when I'm still busy to get some annoying problems solved? Most of the time I do feel like hissing but I'd rather keep my cool and I really hate to dump my anger towards small matters like this.

Well… maybe it's only me and my desire of having some peace and quiet when I'm handling problems.
