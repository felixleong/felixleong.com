{% mark post -%}And so I got my Amano Tarot deck yesterday <333. So consider that as day 1 I&apos;m trying to learn the tarot. Hmm… I&apos;m still pretty much fumbling through the explanations of the book and stuff, and yet I can&apos;t seem to understand them that well :p. Hmm… guess it takes a while, I suppose.

Anyway, I&apos;m giving it a try today, and I got a Judgement/Justice card in reverse. Interesting… somewhat that really kept me thinking… But somewhat I just feel that my thoughts are pretty much controlled by my conscious thoughts that I can&apos;t seem to notice how my subsconcious is reacting. Guess it needs some time to get the hang of it.

Other than that, I&apos;m pretty much staying at home, trying to sort out a lot of things: physically, emotionally and spiritually (somewhat I&apos;m getting all spiritual all of a sudden). Not to mention that my bad habit of piling up important work is starting to show, guess I really have to do something about it >.>. (I really hate myself for this: I&apos;m pretty much making blank promises to myself which I never do >.<")

What else, SEB70 is in the mail today <333!!! And that would be my first 70 minutes 70 songs SEB! And first impression wise: OMG! It really sounded like Eurobeat on steroids XDDD, the quick medley in the beginning sounds like something in PPP3 and it sounds SOOOO cool :D (In a way it does feels like channel surfing with all interesting shows on :p)! Then it transitions into Dark In The Night / Maio & Co and later on and everything is pretty much adrenalin pumping. So for anyone driving a car, DON&apos;T blast this CD into your stereo XDDD.

But speaking of SEB60 and 70, it&apos;s kinda cool to hear the same Eurobeat songs sung by two different artists (i.e. covers <3). I would say this is the first time I ever heard actual Eurobeat covers: Notably Seasons (Loving Now) by King & Queen and Venorica Sales, and Nothing Changed by Dave Rodgers and Norma Sheffield. Squee~ They sounded so special~ Especially Nothing Changed, where Dave sang it with more power, while Norma sang it kind of mellow, which pretty much sets different moods for the same song <3. Ooooh~ I really like the songs now.

Oh yeah! SEB70 comes with a 3" CD packed with Super Extra Track - J-Euro Medley. But then again… it sounded… BAD XDDD. (And I do mean that it sucks XDDD)

Anyway, more work to do! Catch you guys later! Ja&apos;ne! :)

Now I think I got part of the message of the card, and now I&apos;m kind of ashamed of myself. Sorry that I kept looking things from my own perspective only, I really wished that I&apos;m able to see things from your perspective as well…{%- endmark %}
