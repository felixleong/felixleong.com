OK, the sunnier post is up, now it&apos;s the darker things that happened to me lately. Well… not exactly dark, but it&apos;s just not the usual stuff which I wouldn&apos;t post up publicly due to certain reasons (more on that later).

<u><b>Shock #1</b></u>
OK… where should I start… I&apos;m definitely having (sort of) an enemy now… well, I wouldn&apos;t say it was an enemy since I don&apos;t even know who that is in the first place… I should say he&apos;s more like an attacker. I only knew that there&apos;s someone who kept on saying bad things on the Internet to attack and hurt me. I have been quite stunned by the attacks made on me during the past few months, which includes:
- 1st Attempt: Attempting to flood a Yahoo! Group, which is started by me, using my name

- 2nd Attempt: Impersonates me on our university&apos;s forum to make a public "confession" of my feelings towards Choon Hui. What&apos;s make it worse is that it was done a day before my Advanced Artificial Intelligence exam.

- Latest Attempt: Impersonates me in an email to Choon Hui, which contains a link to some sort of… "perverted" website, most probably some website which involves me and him. I&apos;m not sure what kind of website that that person sends, which can only be of two possibilities:
1. My LiveJournal, which might be the first thing that comes to mind, but the possibility is slimmed down by the second possibility
2. An offensive, newly built website just to make the attack, which is much more possible since Choon Hui did mention something like "Geocities" when I called him after I received his personal email to stop that nasty "joke"… which I didn&apos;t commit.

Either way, it&apos;s not a good sign. It seems that someone is definitely attacking me behind the curtains. As much I would say the people involved in this is definitely a chicken and childish, I wouldn&apos;t say that I&apos;m not being the least bit bothered either, since it did cause me some emotional stress… and now it&apos;s definitely going to hurt Choon Hui as well, which is definitely something that I don&apos;t want it to happen in the first place. If someone has to be hurt, it has to be me and not Choon Hui.

The most intiguing part is that who&apos;s the culprit behind it and what&apos;s the motive behind it. I believe it has to be one or some of my coursemates (since they are the only ones who knows me better) and the timing of these events are just too coincidential (the 2nd attempt is done after I posted some Advanced AI revision notes before the exams, and the 3rd attempt is done just after I went to Penang… both of which are the times when I have no access to the Internet). Is it jealousy that caused it? I wouldn&apos;t know *shrugs*. But for now, judging that I have no idea who&apos;s behind it, guess I can&apos;t do anything right now :(.

So, just to be safe, I will be keeping some entries as friends-only, especially those which involves anything extremely personal… and those of Choon Hui&apos;s. I don&apos;t want to risk Choon Hui being hurt again… NEVER! :(

During the Penang trip, Erika confessed her feelings towards me… and there&apos;s a big possibility that Rachael does too (according to Erika, that is). And I&apos;m like… speechless. O_O" This happened pretty much suddenly because she indirectly poured out her story (without the names, of course) and asked for my opinion. At that time, I was pretty surprised that the story is too… familiar… most probably due to the fact that I have suspected this in the beginning. And so I pretty digged it out so carefully to gain more understanding as well as test whether my hypothesis is correct.

And yeah… I&apos;m a bit disturbed after this, since I do have some feelings for them as well. But then again, compared to the feeling I had for Choon Hui, the feelings for them is pretty much more like… friends. >.> Ah well… But it&apos;s kinda awkward later in our trip, but I suppose it&apos;ll return to normal soon :).

Anyway, it has been some relationship related drama going on these days, which is kinda cool since it&apos;s the first time I ever got involved in these. Of course, the flip side is that it does brings more worries in my life. Well, there&apos;s always two sides in a coin, right?

Hmm… I really hope all this will settle nicely soon… and hope that this won&apos;t affect my relationship with Choon Hui… I can only wish for the best now >.>.
