By any chance, this might be the last friends-only post for this month.


Just after I typed my excited entry about my results, Choon Hui just happens to enter the lab.

I don&apos;t know whether this is by sheer chance, or by his own will. But that isn&apos;t of any importance.

He said to me… in his usual kind and friendly voice, that he wants to have a word with me. I smiled… trying to hide the fact that my heart has skipped a beat: This is the time when answers will loom upon me.

And so… I&apos;m outside the lab, with him. Usually my heart will beat a little faster whenever he&apos;s beside me. But today&apos;s a bit different: all of a sudden I just feel a sense of calm. Nothing can explain why that happened, but it seems I&apos;m already knew what is going to happen later.

Everything at that time seems to be of less importance now: I can&apos;t see what is passing around us, I can&apos;t hear what&apos;s going around us, I can&apos;t feel the presence of anything… With all my attention focused on him and every single word. His face is just as usual: friendly and calm.

We talked a lot: About what had happened (apparently someone specially created a really offensive website for that purpose, but hearing him saying, it might contain a link to my LJ, or use it as the basis of the attack), about how angry he was at first, about his own views and stuff. Basically the attacker did send a link to his girlfriend as well, and I guessed that they talked a lot about it when I was feeling down a few days after the incident (refer to the previous "phone call and clinginess issue" post).

He admit that he&apos;s a bit conservative regarding this issue, and he is angry when the attack happened. But he also said that he has been thinking for quite some time, and now tells me everything because he treats me as a friend…


… And there you have it… that&apos;s basically my account of the story.  Of course, I don&apos;t look at it as an end, but a beginning of another new story…
