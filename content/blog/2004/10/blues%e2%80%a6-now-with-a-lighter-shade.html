{% mark post -%}Oh yeah, just jinxed around with my compie stuff yesterday and I notice it&apos;s not my aunt&apos;s computer which is spoilt yesterday, but only the network card ^^". So now I had 3 computers running back at home (excluding the notebook, which I&apos;ll mention about it later), and I have NO idea how to arrange them in such a constrained desk space.

So now I had the (less) painful spoilt hardware list: A notebook, a laser printer, a network switch, a network card and a USB2.0 PCI card.

Luckily the USB and network card is still under warranty so I&apos;ll be doing just that later. Be checking out my notebook later, hope it&apos;ll be "discharged" today. It&apos;s been two months since his absence.

Be getting another USB card today since my webcam still can&apos;t talk with my new compie, and hopefully that&apos;d work *crosses fingers*.

For now, I just hope that my computer woes will end soon (hopefully).{%- endmark %}
