{% mark post -%}Nothing much happened today, except that for some reasons I having some sort of headache (the physical kind).

Anyway, I&apos;m starting to face some of the realities with dealing with people, especially the boss >.>. In general Alfred is a good person, but sometimes he does somewhat irks me… well, guess nobody&apos;s perfect :p. Not to mention I do need to have my communication skills polished up a bit. But my colleagues are great, as much as we don&apos;t talk much, they have been pretty friendly to me.

And second thing is that… it&apos;s the eGenting programming competition again! I just came down from there, and boy the questions are getting tougher! I fare pretty badly this year (again), but at least this time round I can make sense of what the question requires. So that&apos;s an improvement on my side :). Hopefully I can do better next year ^^v.

Anyway, speaking of headaches… maybe I&apos;m just trying to piece puzzles by force lately (i.e. thinking too much)… there&apos;s just a lot of things that I can&apos;t seem to sort out for the time being. Ah well, guess the middle part of the beginning is going to be slightly challenging, I suppose?

OK, that&apos;s about it. Oh yeah, out of the headache-inducing events these few days, it&apos;s great to have Choon Hui in friendly terms again, hope it keeps that way (if not better, as in the definition of friends ^^).{%- endmark %}
