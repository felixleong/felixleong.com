Hmm… recently definitely has seen me with some spoilt hardware, this time are the phones… well, there&apos;re spoilt for some time though. My Sony-Ericsson T100 does suck since it&apos;s secondhand and stuff. Not to mention I&apos;m really bad at maintaining stuff XD. And my house phone is spoilt due to lightning strikes, so I can&apos;t even dial any phone numbers and the ringing is more like croaking XD.

I can&apos;t seem to get my house phone replaced though since I do need to get to their headquarters o_O". But I just traded in my stupid handphone and got a Siemen&apos;s CF62 instead, which is pretty cool with the rich colour screen and the Ooooh~ orange dynamic lights <333, which is much more cooler than the Nokia&apos;s which I originally plan to buy (I plan to get a Nokia for development purposes… well… you know, mobile phone game development?). Anyway, I think I can test those games on my friends&apos; phones anyway :p.

What else, anyway, still enjoying my SEB120 now :). And oooh~ Fantasy <333, I still can&apos;t get bored with this song no matter what. (Hey! That sounds like Fantasy XDDDD) Anyway~ Still trying to figure out the phone functions :p.
