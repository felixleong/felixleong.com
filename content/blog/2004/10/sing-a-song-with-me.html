{% mark post -%}Today&apos;s a pretty fun day with my friends :), and it&apos;s pretty exciting as Steven mentioned that there&apos;s a special guest named Jenny today. OK, before this, actually Steven asked me and a few friends of mine to go to a karaoke lounge, and so I agree to go (as much as my budget doesn&apos;t allow me to… I&apos;m bad :p).

And so… Damn I&apos;m late :p. But yeah I do get a suprise, because the "Jenny" that Steven mentioned is actually Jacob, one of my best friends during college. (w00t!!! :D) It&apos;s been quite a while I haven&apos;t seen him, and I can only say that he didn&apos;t changed much ever since I knew him. And not to mention that Erika, Soo Hoo, Rachael and a few others joined in the fun. So we do have a great time. If there&apos;s any regrets, the karaoke lounge <i>does</i> have Ayumi Hamasaki songs and AAAAH~ I should have at least learn how to sing a few of them >.<" (ANGEL&apos;S SONG and M, in particular). I guess we might have another chance next time :).

Then later on we went to Time Square (one of the shopping malls that I frequent) and the fun doesn&apos;t stop there. Of course, Steven and the gang is pretty much setting up times where Erika and I was left alone. And GOD I&apos;m embarrassed, not to mention that I have <b>totally NO idea</b> what to do since it is considered our first date. And later on it just so happens that I have been through some odd blunders :p, and Steven just keep on dropping pointers on how to be romantic and stuff. Oh god… I never knew it was that hard in the first place.

Anyway, just reached home, relaxing (actually I shouldn&apos;t be since I do have assignments to rush). And tomorrow will be a brand new week for school… and work.{%- endmark %}
