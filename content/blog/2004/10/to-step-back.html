Having a day to enjoy simplicity does give me quite some room to let my wander a bit.

Looking back at what had happened lately, guess it&apos;s time for me to step back and take a good look from another perspective. That alone would have give me enough things to (re)/evaluate, consider and ponder. Sometimes I&apos;m just a bit ashamed for my immaturity, but this is the best chance for me to do something about that.

I&apos;m thinking of picking up tarot now, since I have been fascinated by it. Many a times it did gave me another prespective to look at things (of course, friends would still be the main sources of help ;) ). Not to mention that I saw a deck from Yoshitaka Amano (for those who doesn&apos;t know who he is, he is one of the well known character illustrator/designer for Final Fantasy, especially the early installments), so yeah I&apos;m thinking of getting one tomorrow :p. (although I&apos;m not sure whether it&apos;s a good deck to learn the art of tarot though :p)

Speaking of which, I did get myself Tarot for Dummies for a jumpstart.

Guess that&apos;s all to it. Oh yeah! Happy birthday, shawaazu!!! ^^

- SEB60 in the mail today <3. The remix aren&apos;t too impressive, but it&apos;s still solid nonetheless. Not to mention there&apos;s a lot of female tracks :p.
