Phew! That'll be my second site to be maintained. Lots of work, yet I guess it's worth it. Kind of remind of my days of doing a Final Fantasy fan page (until I'm able to get my hands on the new Final Fantasy, I guess I might not do another one since I think I had enough of Final Fantasy Fanatism LOL)

Anyway, [here's the link](http://myppf.topcities.com/). It's still in prototype phase so not much pictures or any bells and whistles for that matter (except for that mouse-over effect, which is really not something to shout about);)

Anyway, the PPP5 soundtrack is starting to sink in and I'm able to enjoy the newer track now. Phew, it did took me time to get use to new stuff :).

[::Random Stuff::]

- Our Multimedia Technology subject requires us to do an assignment using Macromedia Flash. Currently I'm still working on it, and I assure you that it'll be a big surprise :). I'll post up some thoughts later
- One assignment down, a few more mid-term exams and assignments to go. *sigh*
