After spending the whole day trying to untangle my own emotional knots, I have entered a new emotional low for the day. Debating with myself is really tiring. Luckily I got hold of Ahmed and have some very deep thoughts exchange during the process (umm… should I say that I pour all my emotional burden over him?), and he certainly has made my day. Thanks a lot, Ahmed *hugs tight*!

Then, back home, the first thing I noticed that I forgot to close the window in my room and I ended up having my notes soaked wet! Aiee! Should have been careful!

Then I caught Allen online after 30 minutes I logged on, I purposely get online just to wait for this moment. Then I just took a deep breath, pick up my courage, and pour out my own feelings to him and confessed that I liked him a lot; despite the fact that I really have my own doubts. So it's pretty much expected that I offered a much more shorter term relationship, perhaps you might call it a trail period. But of course, not everyone is going to take it, especially if anyone gets hurt in the past. And yeah, he isn't prepared for it (considering the fact that the attraction between us does happen all of a sudden… like… less than a week?), and tells me to be patient. (well… basically the choice between yes and no are likely to be dead ends in the end, which I firmly believe)

As much as I understand that and know that I really have to give him some time, I just feel my aching heart throbbing… tears are starting to flow down on my cheeks, my head is starting to get so low that it's close to the keyboard, fingers trembling like crazy… It's pain all right, but it's a pleasurable one, never been once I'm able to be truthful to myself to commit something that I desired for emotionally. I always had put social norms, morals and other stuff in front of me during the past, just not this time.

Right now I have yet to let go of my pillow and I'm weeping really hard on it… yet I'm feeling a little proud of myself today, for being truthful to my own feelings and desires. Cheers!
