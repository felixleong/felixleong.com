Just came back from our developer's meeting. I just feel that I'm getting better in socializing, but I do need a lot more work to improve myself ;).

Choreographed the dance for Go Go's and The Monkeys <333. Thinking of filming it tomorrow (but I need to find my chance to film it outdoor, considering the quality I can get ;) ).

Missed Choon Hui a lot right now, guess I have one reason to hate weekends XDDD. As for now, I guess I just sit in front of my compie and dabble a bit with C++.
