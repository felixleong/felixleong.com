Summary: I hate losing, and I really do, no matter how small and temporary that thing is.

Longer Story: Well, apparently someone spotted some original copies of SEB and another friend of mine is going to snatch them all ;\_;. And I DON'T want to skip classes or waste any money because of that. But I still hate the prospect of losing.

Anyway, I'm just getting so disappointed that I do feel crappy now. Guess I'll head for bed soon to sleep it off. Besides, there's always CDJapan. (albeit being expensive due to currency exchange rate and shipping) So I'm not that worried.

Now that does makes me more nervous and anxious in waiting for my parcel from Dom ;\_;.
