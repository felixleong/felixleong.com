I still remembered the time during high school I hated moral classes because we have to memorize all those moral values and our exam essays is like "Someone should/shouldn't do this because (s)he's not practising [insert random moral values here]…", then just hope that the moral values that we put in is within the list of values in the marking scheme.

Yeah right… imagine how I hated the subject during high school.

As much as I'm expecting to hate this subject and just thinking of passing the exams (since it'll *not* be calculated in our CGPA), I was not expecting that I'm going to like it instead. As the class progresses, I'm really starting to enjoy the class. We have been taught above a lot of philosophy and theoratical stuff about how we as human perceive and justify rights and wrongs and how morality and ethics are put into the test in real life. We're still getting slow on stuff such as teleological theories, but I'm hoping to catch up on it soon :).

Now I'm like analysing reactions from myself and others towards different situations… Wow, that gets a lot more confusing than I thought :). Phew! Can't wait for my next Moral class.

[::Random Thoughts::]

- For some reasons, I still can't help with the habit of looking at good looking guys (especially those who has an average body shape, or perhaps slightly meatier). Heck… it seems like I'm hunger for lust from those guys… Mmm…. *feeling kinda skewed* :p *whacks head hard*
- Valentine's day is getting round the corner, that did made me desiring for a serious relationship. But friendly hugs would do the trick in making my day, but I'm pretty much deprived from them in real life.
- Assignment due dates are still panting over my shoulder… Need to keep a faster pace…
