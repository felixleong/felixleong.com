I just received this text message from my sister, and she's so sweet that I'm really touched to tears &lt;=3.

Just to post it up here:

喂，生日快乐啦！本来打算昨天半夜祝福你的不过后来太累了忘记，听讲很多人帮你庆祝噢！你就好啦最重要的是有女朋友嘛！开心吗？心里的矛盾明朗了吗？今天又会去那里通畅一顿啊?好好的出去癫一下啦！虽然我不全了解你在那儿过的是怎样的生活，不过只要你觉得开心就好。下月我会下去噢！再看吧。

**Translation:**

Hey, happy birthday! I was thinking of sending my best wishes to you at midnight, I'm too tired that I forgot about it. I heard that there's a lot of friends celebrating it with you! I'm so jealous (:p), the most important thing is that you already have a girlfriend! (Ed: Umm…. XDDD Well, actually I would say there's a big possibility that I would give it another go when the time is right… which won't be long… I guess XDDD)

Are you happy/having fun? Is all the contradictions in your heart being loosen up? (Ed: The meaning isn't exactly that… but that's pretty much the meaning) Where would you go today? Just be out there and go all out! Although I don't understand fully how's your life been over there, but just make sure that you feel happy.

I'll be coming over next month! We'll see then! :)

…

Sometimes I just feel a bit guilty though… It's like… all my great friends and family always seems to understand how I feel and give me encouragement when I needed it most, and yet it seems that I didn't do anything back in return. Well… I suppose sometimes these kind of thanks are hard to express in words… so we didn't get to know, I guess… &lt;=3
