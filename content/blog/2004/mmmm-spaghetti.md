One good reasons on staying with your aunt than your coursemates: You don't even need to learn how to cook :p. Well maybe I just said so because I just had home made spaghetti just now. Tasty!

In other news, I just finished Eurobeat part for my Flash assignment. Oh boy! I'm going to finish this assignment! And… *stares at my in-tray* God… school sucks. :p Hope I'll survive.
