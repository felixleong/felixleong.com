GPA (based on my calculation, if I'm not mistaken with the grade stuff): 3.5

[:: Edit: Just recalculated with some corrections made ^^" ::]

Interpersonal Communication: I didn't really expect an A for this since I can't finish one of the questions. But as it turns out, I'm so glad with this ^^. Thanks Ms Nicole for her great and inspiring class!

Entrepreneurial Skills and Business Ethics: I'm just glad that I didn't get any worse than this. Period ^^"

Software Engineering Practice: I was quite worried when I didn't fared well in my mid-term exams, but good thing that I prepared early. It's a A-, but it's still great BTW :).

Object-Oriented Programming Techniques: I didn't put high hopes on this one every since I screwed my coursework marks, not to mention that it takes up 35% of the grades. But as it turns out, grades can be saved with more effort ^^.

Advanced Artificial Intelligence: I said to myself that I'd be REALLY sorry to Dr Tay if I didn't get an A for his subject. And so I did. This A is dedicated to you, for being such a kind, understanding and great professor, Dr Tay ^^.

Cryptography: I didn't did well in this subject, but thank god that proves that I did most part of it right ^^.

OMG… OMG… OMG!!!! I can't believe it! This is the best results I ever get ever since I get into this university! :D

I'm SOOOO excited right now~ Bwee~~~~ :D

Thanks everybody for wishing me luck yesterday! All the love goes to you guys there ^^. *glomps everyone* <333
