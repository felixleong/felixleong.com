Just a quickie:

- Rushed, but feeling positive for no apparent reasons
- One assignment deadline postponed, which is *a-good-thing*…
- … but there's other assignments to worry about
- Feeling like dedicating Lolita's Thinking of You to Choon Hui today (and apparently I liked the para as well ^^)
- Aunt Kim Hong just got a administration job in our library, which I do have mixed feelings about it… but most of it being positive
- … and my mom's right about her absent-mindedness being worse than I do
- … and wasted five hours to accompany her to do stuff (medical checkups and what-nots)… which is a bad thing when you have assignments on the borderline
- Have lasagna for the first time… I just feel it tasted kinda weird… Maybe I should try that in a real Italian restaurant
- Got myself a bottle of iced lemon tea concentrated syrup, which I'm going to try later since it's a new product
- Going to be sleep deprived… again
- Last but not least… MY AYU-RO MIX CD IS IN THE MAIL!!! <333 Currently ripping it into MP3s, can't wait to enjoy the CD ^^.
