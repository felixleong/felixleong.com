{% mark post -%}ARGH! I still can&apos;t seem to install Windows XP into my computer! *stabs!*

Anyway… My aunt locked herself out from room yesterday by accident, with all her room keys inside it o_O". Hmm… I hope there wasn&apos;t a virus that causes absent-mindedness.

Luckily the locksmith managed to get it opened today, it took him about an hour though :p.

Later on will be my programming workshop, which equates to quality time with Choon Hui again <3. (Yeah, maybe I&apos;m just obsessive-compulsive XD)

Well… just hope that I can get my computer up by today T-T.{%- endmark %}
