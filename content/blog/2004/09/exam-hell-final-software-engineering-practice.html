Finally! 6 subjects ended just like that! Anyway, today&apos;s question came out to be pretty easy, which I was expecting something much harder today. And so things goes pretty fine with me (minus the rain… or at least I&apos;ve been hearing thunderstorms) >.>

SEB51 came in the mail yesterday <3. Keeping the review short, it&apos;s an extremely great CD by its own right, as much I believe ABeatC did produce some tracks that misses. But most of the track really rocks that you&apos;ll not notice the weaker tracks anyway. Shame On You (Extended Mix) sounded 10 times much cooler than the shorter version in PPP3, which become my favourite track in the CD. Look out for Sophie&apos;s Like An Angle (Extended Mix), Tonight (I&apos;m Ready) (Extended Mix) by Lisa Johnson and, of course, Shake Me Up (Extended Saturday Mix) by Valentina & Mirka (I can imagine Nine shouting for Domino right here now :p). Oh yeah, try to imagine both the old and new Lolitas doing a Go Go Girls number: Right Now, it&apos;s really an experience. :3

Won SEB presents Hyper Star Energy, Super Euro Flash and Virginelle&apos;s Hot Love & Emotion today! W00t! But that also means that my wallet is… duh… flat XD. But thank god I use a debit card to pay or else I would be in the evil debt pool :p.

Anyway, yay for starting to have a SEB CD collection right now :3. (I wished I had the money for SEB 150 though… ;_;)

In other news, the Malaysian government is going to introduce the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in 2007. It is said that it&apos;s somewhat similar to the British VAT system, but I really had no idea after reading the information provided in the papers (and more importantly: Am I going to be taxed for imported CDs? XD). Hmm… Speaking of which… I wonder how much those UK people have to pay to import CDs?

Going back to my hometown tomorrow, so I get to see my parents as well as attend Aunt Ling&apos;s wedding <3. I promise that I&apos;ll take pictures :3. And that also means that you can expect the usual daily updates… and hopefully not the CODS XD.

What else… oh yeah, for those whom I had made promises to, sorry for me being late for everything, but you&apos;ll be expecting some surprises soon :3! Ta-ta for now!
