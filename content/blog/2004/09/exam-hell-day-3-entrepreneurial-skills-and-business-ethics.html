{% mark post -%}I got murdered in this paper >.<". I never expect that the paper came out to be a "do-or-die" paper, as in: 20 marks for each question, which really is a question that expects you to know the EXACT term or you just can&apos;t answer the whole question.

So there goes 60 marks after my really lame attempt to bullshit my way through section B. I suppose I&apos;m able to fare well… well… at LEAST I think I&apos;m able to pass my paper >.>.

Uh… Hope that doesn&apos;t foil my high GPA plan.

Let&apos;s see… Eurobeat CDs are selling like MAD in eBay. Uh… I better keep my hands off from there. Hmm… Let&apos;s see what&apos;s else…

Choon Hui seems to be calm, but… well… he doesn&apos;t seem to be happy with today&apos;s performance. ;_; Well… just hope that the gloomy mood won&apos;t affect my studies today.

Anyway, at least I had an appointment with him :).

Next up: Interpersonal Communication on Friday morning! W00t! <3 (Sorry, I just liked the subject :p){%- endmark %}
