{% mark post -%}Exams tomorrow, still need to rush to the library afterwards. Not sure whether Choon Hui would be around later, but being with him in the library yesterday is definitely great *^.^*.

I think I&apos;ll just ask him later to check whether his coming (on the outset of having lunch together :p).

And as an unrelated note, I lost on the MHNR9 bid ;_;… ah well, I don&apos;t think I can afford anything above US$20 (conversion to local currency: RM78… OUCH!). Ah well, guess I just have to wait next time :) (well… at least I subcribe to my favourite search mailing list so that I don&apos;t miss any chances of seeing it again).

Till then, good luck for everybody here ^^.

Just a boring quiz, nothing much :p.
