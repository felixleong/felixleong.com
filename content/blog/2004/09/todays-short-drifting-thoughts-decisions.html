{% mark post -%}No papers today, but I just keep it short:
- Why when people gives me criticism or advice, the first reaction I had is retaliation, as much as I understand that their intentions are good? Why I always trying hard to resist of giving into sincere advice (which definitely going to bitter and hard) but I just have totally no resistence to soft persuasions which might be bad for me?

I really hope that I can blame human nature for that and get over with it, but then again I can do something to change this behaviour…

- So many decisions to make, yet so little time to consider. I don&apos;t know… I really hate to make bad decisions, but I really can&apos;t differentiate the major life-changing decisions with the minor ones.

In times like this, I just can&apos;t stop feeling a little bit lost… It&apos;s like you know your destination, but you are in some sort of a deserted highway without some sort of signboards or a map in your own hands.

I really wish that I had some sort of guidance to life, yet sometimes things have to handled by your own… (that really reminds me of Chihiro in Sprited Away in the beginning)

- For some reasons, I just can&apos;t seem to get that sort of mentality of people. I really have to stress this loud and clear (at least in my LJ…):
<b>ALTERNATIVE SEXUALITY IS NOT A SHORTCOMING!</b> It&apos;s partly fate (well… we can&apos;t choose our DNA or hormonal construction) and MOSTLY choice. I chose to be bisexual not because I&apos;m not able to control my own sexual desires, but I made that decision because I firmly believe that love knows no barriers.

Being human, these people have the same and equal right to love and be loved, and definitely does not deserved to have their decisions unrespected.


Guess I just leave it as that… anyway, just found Maharaja HI-NRG Night 9 on eBay! <333 (translation: I&apos;m definitely getting the CD which has Don&apos;t You Love Me / Virginelle in it! [as long as the price doesn&apos;t go beyond what I can afford] <3)

[: unrelated note : The woodwinds in the classical rendition of Ayumi&apos;s vogue always seem to make me want to cry for some reasons… it&apos;s just beautiful and sad when I listen to it ;_;]{%- endmark %}
