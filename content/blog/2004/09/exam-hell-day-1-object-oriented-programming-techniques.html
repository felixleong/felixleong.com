Today&apos;s the day! Ooo the nervous energy running in me ._.". Anyway, I won&apos;t be updating, but basically you can imagine most part of my life would be totally books (… OK, maybe not, maybe add in some friendly stuff in the library [most probably I would update my LJ if that&apos;s the case ;)] and the CODS, you know what I mean ;) ).

Steven is staying over my place during this period, so rest assured that if I ever failed a subject, it won&apos;t be "I missed an exam schedule :p". Myeh~ but I&apos;ll make sure that I DON&apos;T even fail one.

What else, OH YEAH! Today&apos;s exams, anyway, despite the lack of preparations, the questions came out to be easy… if not time consuming X(. The questions are pretty tricky, but I still manage to put up some valid answers (at least that&apos;s what I assume). But I believe I should fare well on that one.

Hope I can score a high GPA this time, just to save my own grace :p.

Next up: Cryptography on Monday morning! Wish me luck!
