{% mark post -%}Today&apos;s just another boring day, with me staying at home, being unproductive.

Watch the the whole set of Fruit Basket anime on my compie for the whole day, and almost all episodes seems to strike a chord with me, Tohru&apos;s words are really touching… I just can&apos;t help but feeling touched with tears flowing down my cheeks. It seems that there&apos;s a lot of things that I&apos;m starting to forget… a lot of strong feelings starts to fade from me. And now it seems that I&apos;m trying to pick them back up: piece by piece, fragments by fragments.

Most of the time, I just feel that I suddenly didn&apos;t understand what I believe that I understood. But I guess everyone had their own times feeling a bit lost in their own path.

Anyway, I&apos;m learning Japanese now, as much the only thing I had is the self-help books that I bought.

Just before I sign off, here&apos;s a line I plucked from the anime (obviously it&apos;s a translation which I recalled from memory, do correct me if have mistaken): "When you care for somebody, sometimes you&apos;ll feel hurt… and sometimes you&apos;ll feel lonely. But… it&apos;ll also bring happiness."
