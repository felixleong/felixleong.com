I&apos;m SOOO random on Monday XD.

OK, longer story: Went to the library, saw Erika and Rachael, then we just joke around while we are doing our revision. The joke&apos;s on me today because Erika kept poking fun of me for Rachael&apos;s "Most Handsome Guy" vote on our university&apos;s message forum. And I don&apos;t really know whether I would say that I&apos;m flattered or embarrassed XD.

Later on, I notice that I do have some coupons for free quarter chicken at Nando&apos;s, and all of a sudden we just decide on the spot to go to Mid Valley to have dinner there. It was so random that when we tried to ask a few more friends out, they are like "Huh?! Are you REALLY serious?! o_o||" XD. Of course it ends up having only us going in the end. :p We really had fun there, and just to cut the story short:

Obviously someone is having a bad hair day yet kept his smile in front of the camera for the sake of it :p.

As a sidenote, I&apos;m the lucky owner of this CD <3! W00t!

Those girls are really sweet <=3. Nice to have them as friends.

Yesterday is definitely a slow day… and I really missed Choon Hui dearly <=(. Well… Then despite being busy, I just wrote something just to keep myself from over-dwelling with that feeling. Other than that it&apos;s just hitting the books and trying to make any sense of cryptography. Ugh…

And today is just plain exciting in a way, since I got to be with Choon Hui for almost the whole day <3. Anyway, basically we just came to have some discussion with Dr Tay regarding the final year project supervisor issue. I don&apos;t really know, it seems that Choon Hui is much more friendlier today, which is really sweet of him (as much I believe it was on friendly terms and nothing more). I don&apos;t know, maybe it&apos;s just me, I guess.

Guess I&apos;ll stop here for now, it&apos;s pretty late >.>. Anyway, as a side note, Chinese Shan Dong food is pretty nice <3.{%- endmark %}
