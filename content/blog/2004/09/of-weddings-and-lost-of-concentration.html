Today&apos;s Aunt Ling&apos;s wedding ceremony, it&apos;s pretty simple actually, but it went perfectly and I&apos;m just happy to see her and Uncle Vincent married happily. ;)

As much as that, I have been thinking too much ever since yesterday: from what I have left off yesterday to my future plans. Perhaps so deep in thought it seems that I&apos;m pretty much didn&apos;t paid attention to <b>anything</b>!

I&apos;m still evaluating and considering whether I really need that digital camera, because that would really bang my budget by the thousands.

Going back to KL tomorrow, having a workshop going on Tuesday. I&apos;m really looking forward to that, since I&apos;ll be going with the special someone (I think most of you should know who that is ;) ).

Felix signing off now.
