{% mark post -%}When I access to LJ, I noticed that the the Live Post Stats is pretty… strange :p. Imagine seeing a perfect 18000 post/hour and 300/minute kind of numbers while you access LiveJournal.

Yesterday was pretty much a mixture of good and bad: Choon Hui seemingly giving me the impression that he&apos;s giving me the cold shoulders during the workshop :(. Well… he&apos;s extremely busy lately with work and stuff, which is really understandable, but I somewhat can&apos;t help but feeling a bit lonely at times like this.

Anyway, the good stuff is that my computer <b>finally</b> worked, stupid CPU front-side bus (FSB) jumper setting! So I pretty much spent the whole day fiddling with it :). And yeah for DVDs and super fast CD ripping!

The downside? My notebook hard drive and my new webcam just refuse to talk with it X(! ARGH!!!! I wonder what&apos;s wrong with the webcam, I need to try it out in another computer. I <b>swear</b> that I&apos;ll be careful with Logitech products because they always hate me. (anyhow I think I have to check with Logitech&apos;s tech support… as much I knew they won&apos;t be much help either)

And yeah! I <i>finally</i> decided to give Gmail a go! :) For those who wanted to mail me, add me in your address book with the mail address <i>felixleong(at)gmail.com</i>. Change the (at) into @ because I&apos;m just paranoid with spammers :p (but then again, that&apos;s what GMail is up to do XD).

What else…. Well… I&apos;m just off grabbing some freeware for my new compie. Till then, just hope that stupid webcam works.

[p/s: For some reason Utada seems to grow in me now :3]{%- endmark %}
