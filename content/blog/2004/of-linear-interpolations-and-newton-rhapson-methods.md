Hah, talk about maths. I always thought that they are all formula with no physical use.

But today, one of my friends came and ask me about using the linear interpolations and Newton-Rhapson methods. I'm somewhat reluctant to refresh my memory (ugh… maths always gives me the headache), but I tried my best anyway. So we went on and on in trying to attempt and apply these methods for his theory of interest (the optional subject that I'm not taking) problems.

After spending some time with nailing down the concepts in his brain (and mine as well), I suddenly find that there's practical use for these mathematical methods (although we only use it to estimate the interest rates) and those mathematical formula starts to make sense now.

Now I'm glad to say that maths is really fun! (but wait until I do more maths problem, I can assure you that this feeling will wear off really soon!) XD

- Argh! I do hate my tendency to repay my sleep debts… they always made me late for classes.
- No weekends for me, those are reserved for a lot of work!
- I'm going to the stationery store and get some art cards afterwards. What make them so special that I have put it in my LJ? Check out my next entry… tomorrow.
