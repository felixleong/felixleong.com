It drizzled the whole night yesterday *shivers*. Talk about a cold morning today.

While I'm on my way to school on the bus, a spider just came out of nowhere and crawls over my hand. I'm quite fascinated to see it because it was quite a beautiful spider. The spider, about the size of the head of a map pin, have a metallic green (which shines) head with a black spot in the middle and its black body have some specks of gold. The striped legs are kind of a goldish brown, with its fang is of a much lighter colour than its legs.

It's quite fun to see it crawling around your hands in a non-aggressive manner. In order to avoid it to crawl into my shirt on anything, I tried to shift it around from one hand to another. Suddenly the bus jerked a bit and the spider just cling onto its thread on my hand, and later on it did looked a bit panicked. It's fun seeing it.

Once I reached my university, I just release it back to nature, where I believe is where it belong.

In other news, a schoolmate from another course has emailed me, asking me whether I'm able to give her some remedial tuition classes to prepare for her mid-terms. For one thing, I know that I never know her in the first place, considering that she only knew me on our school forums.

Hmmâ€¦ let see what happens next.
