I was really thinking of snagging alycorn's Stupidity user icon now.

Just to recap:

- My webcam still refuse to cooperate, even with a new USB PCI card X(
- My notebook is discharged, but the service charges they charges me is like… for NOTHING! My notebook doesn't get fixed AT ALL X(. ARGH!!!!

Anyway… tons of headache-inducing events are occuring now. Just hope I can manage it.
