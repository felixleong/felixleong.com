The rain is getting nastier by the day, and the wind is really relentless in some way. Bleh… I hate to mention about Malaysian weather, it's always either blazing hot or shivering cold (and wet) and by some rare chance you'll get nice weather.

While I'm helping my friends out with their assignments, one of my friends remarks does made me quite embarrassed… And all of a sudden I feel that I didn't understand almost every one of my friends O\_O". Seriously, it's like… I never understood them at all: their likes and dislikes, their personalities and reactions, bits and pieces of their personal life… Kinda remind me of one of Ayumi Hamasaki's song: Because of You (Umm… Is it? I vaguely remembered the meanings of the lyrics). Uhh… Now I don't think I understood Choon Hui that well either, which did made me feel like that I said the wrong things most of the time. >.>

I wonder whether I'm just being hard on myself? I do need to have my perfectionism toned down a bit and take things a bit easy.

Anyway, I have been digging back all my game music MIDI and listening to it, now I kinda miss all the wonderful RPGs that I had played before. Guess I might dig those games back up some day. (especially FF6 <333)
