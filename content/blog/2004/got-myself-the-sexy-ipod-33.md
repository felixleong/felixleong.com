OK, I got defeated by the public hype and I got myself the third generation iPod instead yesterday, since I can't wait for months to get the fourth generation one. But strolling two different malls just for one HDD based MP3 player is definitely tiring.

So I'm just sitting here, enjoying my CD collections in my pocket. Speaking of CD collections… the iPod doesn't accept OGG files. Poo! >.<" So now I need to convert about 20 CDs again before I can load them into my player, worse… my PPP soundtracks are all in OGG format T-T. Guess I might need some time to do some work.

Other than that… assignments are piling up again, need to be more prepared this time, and I'm in dire need for a cure for love sickness. And yeah! I learn one important lesson today: Pay attention in class, because you never know that you'll understand one subject better because of that!

Hmm…
