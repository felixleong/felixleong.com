Both of my designs got rejected, as much as I have spent nearly a week to produce them! AAAARRRRGGGHHH!!!!

*stabs!* *strangles!* *drown* *slaugthers!* *[insert-any-creative-form-of-murder-here]!*

If they don't want a anime like cover, THEY SHOULD TELL ME EARLIER SO THAT I DON'T NEED TO WASTE MY TIME AND SLEEP WORKING THAT HARD! AAAARRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!

*thinking of deleting them straight away… but yet cools down before I actually do so*

I love my cover arts ;\_\_\_\_; *sniff* … and I'm proud of them as well, because it's been a while I haven't been drawing actual artwork ;\_\_\_\_; *sniff sniff*…

Ah well… guess I have to design a few abstract ones (which is something that I'm more confident in doing in less than 1 day).

Being a brave soul, I bought Nuage's Nothing's Gonna Take My Love From You from @Music… and… yeah, I hate Nuage for slaughtering it ;\_\_\_\_;. I would rather see a Karen's Nothing's Gonna Take My Love From You 2004 than a really… nevermind. Really looking forward to see a listing in eBay for SEB18 (which contains the original version)

*listens to it more and see whether it'll sink ;\_\_\_\_\_\_;*

…

Feeling like doing two stupid things in one day… that makes me a really sad Felix.
