Darn! Got a deadline tomorrow and I can't believe that I procrastinated. >.<"

Anyway, pretty much by accident I found out my CD with my Memorial address music files <333. So I didn't lost them after all. So there I go, enjoying Memorial address on the bus. Then while "No way to say" and "forgiveness" is playing, some sort of unexplainable emotions just struck me that I feel like crying. I really don't know what kind of emotion that I'm experiencing: it's not some sort of emotions which can be identified, like "disappointment, happiness, sorrow, touched"; it's a extremely complex and strong feeling, something which I really can't comprehend. If there's anything I knew… I really like Choon Hui… a lot, in fact. Yes, I'm OK with living without him, I'm OK that I can't be with him, but it's just that… his presence makes my life fuller.

But it's a good thing though. Well… at least that's what I perceive it to be.

Later on, things get slightly better, manage to have fun with friends, finally I got a respond from the seller of my bid. Got a extremely good feedback from him. At least I know that my CD should be in the postal service now. And now I do need to find more information for our Interpersonal Communication assignment, which is about responding to criticism. So… guess that should constitute on what I'm going to do today :).
