AIIEEE…!!! Why there's always hotheaded freaks on the boards who just like to ignite flames for the tiniest details? Gah! Is it that Malaysian always produce bad boardies. Great….

Anyway… Good news: My loans has been cashed into my bank account. One of my best friend from my hometown ask me for supper just now and we had a great time chatting nonsense. That was fun!

Currently I'm fixing up a really messy board. Stupid jerks!
