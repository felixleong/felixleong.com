Phew! My Flash assignment is over :), and the response is great! ;) Yay for two months of work and no more trail period Macromedia Flash to work with (aww… I'm starting to like it… ;\_;)

So now I can concentrate a bit more on school work now. And yeah speaking of school, my assignment marks for my Moral & Ethics subject is demoralizing (quoting a friend, that's funny XD). I have to work on my database assignment… got my exam slip (thank god I went early, the queue is horrible just after I get mine)… Yeah, it's kind of boring.

Then now I'm stranded at school because the Students Affairs Department (ugh…) is going to hold a meeting with the committee members of all societies (whom I am one). To be frank, I really don't feel like going there, not only because it's from the department-that-I-hate-to-deal-with, it's the monsoon season, and it tends to rain around the time when the meeting is held! Great, I wish I'm going to be lucky today (no rains + short meeting), which I had my doubts.

On a final note, got Ganguro (one paralist friend from Sabah) on the line yesterday and it's nice chatting with someone with a lot in common. It's a really good antidote for depression.

(p/s: Oh yeah, in case you want to see the Flash: it's [here](http://www.kirakira.org/ftp/MYPPFAnimation.swf). Hmm… I wonder if anyone would commission me for a legit, older version of Flash from ebay XD)

[::update:: I got lucky! Thank god! XD ::]
