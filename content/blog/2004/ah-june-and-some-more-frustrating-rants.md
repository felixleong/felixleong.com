Oh~ June! Time does fly, I guess, now I just feel like I have already wasted half a year doing pretty much nothing than having nasty exam results XD. This also signal quite a number of things: after another month, it'll be half year after I started the journal, having participated in PPStage for half year, know a lot of great friends for half year (Ahmed and Phil comes to mind ^^)… have NOT been actively participating in RPGamer for half year >\_>…. Well… reading some of my past entries does brings back memories.

Anyway, the timetable is being messed up again, but the changes aren't that drastic, but having one lecture at 8 in the morning. Augh! That's not fun (Thank god it's only one).

Other than that, no snail mail yet for me… ;\_;. I'm pretty sure that Nine's package is stuck some post office somewhere, and my CDs from Dom should be floating around somewhere…. but no, there still no sign of them. I just hope they don't get stucked in the customs >.>.

After two days of heavy rain, it's getting hot again. Bah! I'm now in a nasty mood X(.

[:: UPDATE ::]

Just got a mail from Sherman… and I didn't get the pixel artist job ;\_;. Ah well, it's better that way 'cause my timetable sucks anyway :p.
