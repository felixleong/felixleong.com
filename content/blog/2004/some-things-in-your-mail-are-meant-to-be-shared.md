Here's an extract of some good stories from a few newsletters I subscribed:

## The Two Wolves

An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. "A fight is going on inside me," he said to the boy. "It is a terrible fight between two wolves.

"One is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, greed, regret, lies, self-pity, arrogance, guilt, resentment, inferiority, false pride, superiority and ego.

"The other is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth,
compassion and faith.

"This same fight is going on inside you -- and inside every other person, too."

The grandson thought for a minute and then asked his grandfather, "Which wolf will win?"

The old Cherokee replied, "The one you feed."

## ON THE PERSONAL SIDE: One moment at a time

Brighten is 8 years old. She used to ask me tough questions: "Why is there war? Who was Hitler? Why did people crash airplanes into those buildings?"

I avoided these questions. I didn't know what to say and I felt horrible explaining such conflict and pain.

After a while she stopped asking me tough questions.

But conflict is part of this world, and Brighten needs to find a way of living that offers meaning and fulfillment; even with the violence around us.

So I've stopped avoiding the questions. And here's one part of my answer:

Brighten, there are troubled people in the world who do shocking things to express their frustration and try to make changes.

I am also trying to change the world, but I take a different approach. I am improving the world one person at a time, one conversation at a time, one moment at a time. In business, that means one customer at a time.

Of course I am human, too, and I make mistakes. Sometimes I get upset and say or do something I wish I hadn't.

When that happens, I try to remember my point of view, my philosophy (that's a big word):

"As long as this world is a place of chaos and turbulence and beauty and joy, I will live to touch the lives of others and brighten their way of being, thus brightening mine."

One conversation at a time. One person, one moment. Like this moment. That's why we named you Brighten.

With lots of love,
   - Your Dad
