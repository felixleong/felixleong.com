The study loan has been banked in today, phew, talk about good timing… But that does mean that I have to plan everything in advanced for six months. I can't take the risk of burning a hole in my wallet again. So currently I have planned out:

- all my living expenses for six months, that should leave me a few thousand backs to spare.
- saving about RM2000 for my unplanned trip overseas, possibly the US (Target: about RM3800 >> US$1000… but I do wonder how much living cost I need for a two weeks trip there on a budget. Anyone has a good estimate on that?)
- fork out another RM1500 for a iPod (thinking of getting it in the weekends)
- to avoid any over spending, I really have to cut down my entertainment costs though… especially on CDs from ordered from oversea ;\_\_;. I'm planning to earn the money for those (hmmm… I wonder how much I got for the data cleaning job last time)
- might need some extra cash for books, but hopefully the library will have most of the books I need
- thinking of sparing RM1000 for investments… but I might dump the travel funds into that as well in hopes that it'll be able to grow in value

Other than that, I do need to be quite careful with it this time to avoid any surprises later. Speaking of surprises, having your knees knocked hard on a steel table leg isn't fun… especially when it happens thrice! Oww…
