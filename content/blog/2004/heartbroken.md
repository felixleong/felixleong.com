Today isn't a really good day for me: My CD-ROM is acting up on me and wouldn't let me read any more disk for the time being, my classes are getting even more boring, and… my crush came to my house and get the rest of his things.

As you might not know, previously we are being room-mates at the same house before he moved out. Today, he just came here and take the rest of his stuff that he left behind previously. As much I'm trying to hold myself back, the internal struggle inside is just very torturing: my heart is like being torn apart, tears are trying to burst out yet I have to maintain my cool, I really wanted to give him a really big hug but I can't (there's someone accompany him).

He knows that I had the crush on him, but I also know that it's impossible because he's got a girlfriend and I know his sexual orientation really well (Hope I'm not offending anybody by letting you know that I'm a bisexual, but have the extra hots for guys). I know it's impossible yet I'm still clinging on that minute possibility. Just by the thoughts of it just makes me feel really vulnerable.

Looking back at my translation on Deluxe by Key-a-Kiss (check the PPStage forums for that), I guess that song does really applies to me in a lot of ways. Just that sometimes there're scars too deep that time could not heal. (I did take the quote from LOTR: ROTK alright…)

Guess I really needed some sleep… Good night…
