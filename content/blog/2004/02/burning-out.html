Gah~ I just want to cut this short: SCHOOL IS KILLING ME!!!!
(Okay, I only needed the tension relieve. And… *take a deep breath* there)

Anyway, I just added a lot of virtual Post-it notes on my desktop reminding me every single deadline and you don&apos;t really want to see my desktop covered with canary yellow rectangles. As for now, I try to get everything out of my way and get over with it. Darn… I&apos;m in total panic now, hope I&apos;m able to keep myself in one piece as long as I can hold it.

Wish me luck then…
