Phew! That&apos;ll be my second site to be maintained. Lots of work, yet I guess it&apos;s worth it. Kind of remind of my days of doing a Final Fantasy fan page (until I&apos;m able to get my hands on the new Final Fantasy, I guess I might not do another one since I think I had enough of Final Fantasy Fanatism LOL)

Anyway, <a href="http://myppf.topcities.com/">here&apos;s the link</a>. It&apos;s still in prototype phase so not much pictures or any bells and whistles for that matter (except for that mouse-over effect, which is really not something to shout about);)

Anyway, the PPP5 soundtrack is starting to sink in and I&apos;m able to enjoy the newer track now. Phew, it did took me time to get use to new stuff :).

[::Random Stuff::]
- Our Multimedia Technology subject requires us to do an assignment using Macromedia Flash. Currently I&apos;m still working on it, and I assure you that it&apos;ll be a big surprise :). I&apos;ll post up some thoughts later
- One assignment down, a few more mid-term exams and assignments to go. *sigh*
