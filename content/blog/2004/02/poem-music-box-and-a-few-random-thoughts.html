<b><u>Music Box</u></b>

<i>Prelude:</i>
I remembered… the time we first met
When my eyes are focused on you
And hearing your crystal like voice
The storekeeper said you are special
But care must be taken
Because once broken
It&apos;s hard to repair
Harder to replace
But I never noticed
What I heard was your charming song…

<i>Progression:</i>
I remember… the time we finally be together
When my eyes are focused on you
And you&apos;re sitting there, being silent
I gently wind you up
And you let out ticking sounds
As if you are telling me something
It&apos;s hard to understand
Harder to feel what you are feeling
But I never noticed
What I heard was your charming song…

<i>Interlude:</i>

I remembered… the time we had spent together
When my eyes are focused on you
And you&apos;re sitting there, looking old
I got bored with your repetitive songs
Yet I let you make the same ticking sounds
But it&apos;s seems that your ticking sounds are getting louder
Perhaps you are telling me that you&apos;re working too hard?
Or is it that you are writhing in pain all along?
But I never noticed
What I heard was your muffled and repetitive song…

<i>Finale:</i>
I remembered… the time…
When my eyes are focused on you
And you are sitting there, unable to sing
I only see a broken spring, your lost teeth, and a worn-out drum…
I&apos;m starting to miss your songs…
But it seems that the only sound I can hear:
You are hard to repair
And you are harder to replace

I never noticed all along
That you are so fragile
That you are trying to keep me happy all along
That it time that you have to leave me alone

What I hear now…
Is the your dissolving songs in my memory…
the sound of my tears falling to the ground…
And the mournings deep down in my heart…

[:: Random Thoughts ::]
- It seems that I had written a lot of sad poems lately, but I didn&apos;t feel particularly down. Perhaps what I&apos;m writing is reflecting my inner desires and experience? (Well… looking at the bright side of things, at least I didn&apos;t get a writer&apos;s block when I&apos;m writing these)
- For some unknown reasons, I got a craving for Coke. Darn, have to stop that before I got an addiction. XD
