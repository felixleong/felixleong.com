As mentioned some time back, it seems that some people see that own flaws easily and there are some who sees it the other way, I&apos;m usually the one that does the former. And this time, I noticed that I always have a tendency to give ideas to others: you know, useless information about yourself that you perceive yourself to be. Something like: "Sorry, I tend to have my thoughts jumbled up", "Ah~ It&apos;s just only me being hyper~"… Although that does help people to understand you a little bit better, but isn&apos;t that a little bit… well… over hyped? Sometimes it does sound to me like a tactic to get attention (I noticed some of my friends who do this does sound like it).

Hmm…

Wait a sec, am I giving you ideas about me giving out ideas? XD
