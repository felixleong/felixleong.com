Today is another day, while people in Malaysia are having their pleasant holidays, I&apos;m back in my room not feeling that well. Although my sore throat has healed today (which is a good thing), I&apos;m now experiencing fatigue throughout the whole body. And now I have an aching back, a little drowsiness, and a minor running nose. Not to mention that there&apos;s a lot of phlegm stuck in my throat, so I&apos;m constantly going to the bathroom to cough them out.

Interesting to note that while I&apos;m finding the spelling of phlegm, the dictionary gave me the following definition:
<b>Noun: phlegm</b> <font size="-2">flem</font>

<ol>
<li>Apathy demonstrated by an absence of emotional reactions</li>
<li>Expectorated matter; saliva mixed with discharges from the respiratory passages; in ancient and medieval physiology it was believed to cause sluggishness</li>
<li>Inactivity; showing an unusual lack of energy</li>
</ol>
Hmm… that does describe my current situation well.

Not only that, for some reason, feeling sick and bad memories and emotions are really a bad match, yet they always come together as an annoying pair. Currently my brain is still flushing in memories of my previous crush and the time I have been together with him as room-mates. As how many times I tell myself it is really hard (near impossible) to make it work, the hurt yet doesn&apos;t want to heal yet. Perhaps I&apos;m just deprived from warmth of caring love? Or is it that I&apos;m feeling weak?

Tears came dropping down while I&apos;m working with my school work (I have to drag myself to do it, cause the workload is just too much if I don&apos;t). Feeling hurt physically or emotionally is one thing, feeling hurt for both at once is another. I just don&apos;t know why I put up with it, I don&apos;t know why I&apos;m reluctant to tell anyone about it? Am I trying to be strong? Or am I just acting to be one?

Guess I just pop in some relaxing and happy tunes to keep me a little bit occupied from any depressing thoughts for now…
