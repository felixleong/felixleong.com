Today I just accompany my aunt to go to the airport, since granny have to go to Singapore today and we have to accompany her since she&apos;s can&apos;t really walk well. Well, she&apos;s not my real granny, she&apos;s actually a cook for my late uncle previously and now my aunt is taking care of her. Now she has to go to Singapore for a few days to be with her relatives, so I&apos;ll be quite lonely at home these days.

Anyway, while I&apos;m in the airport, I was thinking of travelling! :) Thinking about it, I would really want to expand my horizons and go out and see and experience things for myself. And it&apos;s kind of neat to know some of the boardies that I have been chatting to :).

But then again, *opens up wallet and see moths fly* Sigh, looks like I&apos;m going to be stranded in Malaysia for quite some time. Anyway, I&apos;m planning to travel around once my holidays starts :). At least I got a head start of things :). Hopefully I can visit Japan and the US soon after. Dream on, Felix! :D

[::Random Stuff::]
Hmm, my quiz results. Kind of true, but I&apos;m not sure. I can&apos;t see what people see of me :).
