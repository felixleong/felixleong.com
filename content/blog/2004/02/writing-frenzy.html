{% mark post -%}OK, I&apos;m going to do away with my usual ranting at school, so let me just steer away from that.

Anyway, I just notice that I&apos;m picking up my writing hobby back! The last time I remember that I attempted at writing is in high school: during that time, I got an enthusiastic teacher (perhaps over-enthusiastic) who likes students to be involved in writing Chinese literature. And he got so many contacts and has a really keen ear in getting news about writing competitions, and he always use that and try to lure more students to get into writing. (And apparently I&apos;m one of them… the prize money is way too tempting for about 200~2000 words ^_^") And I remembered myself developing a liking to write short stories about the good things in life, and short poems that uses a lot of analogies and smilies.

Then after I went to college, I have no time to write anything so I have just been putting my notepad to dust. But I still let those creative juices deep down in my brains. (However it started to dry up lately) And now, since I got the luxury of having a wireless Internet connection now, I got more chance in putting my thoughts in writing (by participating in forums, posting up LJ entries, reading more stuff…). I&apos;m pretty much new to writing anything in English (since I only write every single piece of work in Chinese), but that doesn&apos;t stop me from trying something fresh. I still write Chinese literature, however I can&apos;t seem to find online friends to share them with :).

Digging back some of my stuff that I have commented in Almond&apos;s journal (Hope ya don&apos;t mind, Ahmed ;) ), here&apos;s some of the stuff that I had previously written:

--- <b>Random Touchy Thoughts</b>
1. Anyway, it&apos;s always been bothering me that why other people would see the gifts in us that we always didn&apos;t appreciate? Is it we&apos;re over abundant with it? Or it is that we are blinded by the gaps and flaws that we had. Perhaps we can&apos;t always see what we gave to others, that what makes everyone special. :)

2. Having someone dear to you leaving always will create a gap at first, but I also believe that before they leave, they secretly planted a seed in the gap. It might seem empty and bare at first, but if you take care of yourself and nurture yourself and others, your heartplace will be blooming with flowers: a garden of memories and hope.

Life goes on… but pleasant memories and hope will continue to live on. :)

### Too bad…

Too bad…  
I can&apos;t be able to modify memories  
Therefore you still have to live with it

Too bad…  
I can&apos;t be able to heal your pains  
Therefore you still have to bear with it

Too bad…  
I can&apos;t be able to change anything  
Therefore you still have to move on your own

But…  
I&apos;m here to encourage  
In hopes that there&apos;s still place to store good memories

But…  
I&apos;m here to sit down and listen  
In hopes that I&apos;m able to share your pain

But…  
I&apos;m here to be around somewhere  
In hopes that I&apos;m able to accompany you down the road

Too bad…  
We might be taking separate ways later  
But…  
There&apos;s always hope, and I&apos;m always there  
Making sure that hopes will reach you  
Sometime, somewhere…

I leave that for now, I&apos;ll post more if I can remember where I post the others.
[p/s: Gah! This is the third time I ever missed stuff… Oh, by the way, do check my user info for another poem of mine]{%- endmark %}
