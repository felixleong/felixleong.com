{% mark post -%}May past hurts will be left behind without a trail, and hope that I&apos;m able to move further towards my dreams…

<b><u>Empty Bed</u></b>
When I open my door
My eyes gleamed over you
But you aren&apos;t really there
Except for that empty bed

I let my burden down away from my shoulders
I wanted to tell you how tough it was
But you aren&apos;t really there
Except for that empty bed

I trailed my fingers over the linen
Slowly closing in to your soft hair
But you aren&apos;t really there
Except for that empty bed

Slowly I sit myself down
Wishing for a lovely embrace
But you aren&apos;t really there
Except for that empty bed

Gently I lay my tired body down
Wishing to see your angelic face before I sleep
But you aren&apos;t really there
Except for that empty bed… …

(I wish I&apos;ll never wake up
 To be with you as long as I do
 In the same empty bed
 But you aren&apos;t really there… …)

Albeit a little bit sad, this poem is dedicated to an important friend I chatted today who gave me the spark of idea. Thank you for being my friend, and hope this&apos;ll continue as long as it can be maintained.

Continue to dream, my friends :).{%- endmark %}
