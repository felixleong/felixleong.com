Today is just another mixed day: Happiness mixed with frustration. Anyway, there are just something that didn&apos;t work out right today, not really that serious: my latest sig into Netscape&apos;s web space, my research project&apos;s program down, a test that I should know but I don&apos;t (forgot to do my readings :p).

But the good thing is that I just got a Nokia pen for research purposes (which WORKS, unlike the Logitech one), got my assignment groups aligned (a little), and a holiday tomorrow. :D But I can&apos;t do much other than catching with my school work though :p. Anyway, it&apos;s still great to have some time for myself.

Random thoughts of the day:
1. Somewhat I still feel that my past hurts are still there, but think about it, it&apos;s more like strong emotions which has no where to be expressed. Unexpressed love, fears, gratefulness, hatred…

2. Cocky friends, and whether negative kind of obsession of things/hobbies/passion would make you selfish and sick. I don&apos;t know… but what I do know is that I did commit that kind of offence, and it&apos;s pretty much true…
