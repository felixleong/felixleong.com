PHEW~ Finally I managed to finish my assignments and handed it up on time. What a relief!

But because of that, I haven&apos;t been sleeping since 10 yesterday… it&apos;s pretty funny since I usually can&apos;t do without at least 8 hours of sleep. (Although I do feel like sleeping now, but I can&apos;t) Perhaps it&apos;s either the job responsibility, or… well, God bless :).

Anyway, I&apos;m now able to live normally, but perhaps not for long since my mid-term exams are coming up really soon and there are other assignments for me to settle with. Till then, let me just enjoy a peaceful day without any worries.

Oh… by the way, I&apos;m totally drenched now due to the fact it&apos;s raining really heavily on my way home. Worse still is that I&apos;m totally barehanded! Just took a shower just now… hopefully I don&apos;t get sick :).
