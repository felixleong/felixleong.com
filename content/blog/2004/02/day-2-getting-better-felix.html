{% mark post -%}Wellâ€¦ my sickness is getting better now after having a good 6 hours sleep yesterday. Yeah! :) Although I did get some occasional sneezes and my knees hurt a little if I over-stretch it, other than that everything is fine. (I might consider getting those canned Campbell soup though, kinda miss them :) )

Other than that, I&apos;m now trying to focus my energy to finish up my Flash assignment and my mid term tests, so hopefully my plans going to work. I had delegated the other assignments to my group members, as much as I&apos;m a bit worried, I just hope that everything will turn out well. If possible, I think I better finish off the stuff at hand now and get back to them later (maybe my perfectionist/manipulator side of me is getting the better of me :p)

My moral class is pretty interesting today, our lecturer is talking about Immanuel Kant&apos;s Categorical Imperative ethics theory. To cut things short, the theory emphasizes the maxim "Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You", and it&apos;s really interesting that not only the theory emphasizes the importance of respecting others as a human being, but also respect yourself for the same reason. :)

I never knew theory subjects can be fun.{%- endmark %}
