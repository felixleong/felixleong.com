Wee~ I got a tentative travel plan within this year, let&apos;s see… I&apos;m thinking of going to Penang possibly this May, and during the end of December I&apos;m thinking of going to Singapore <3!

Speaking of going to Singapore, I might need a passport… but I still don&apos;t what procedures is required (I only knew that I need to get my document and blah blah blah to the immigration department or something… but the details are kind of fuzzy). Guess I&apos;ll ask my brother some time later (since he&apos;s studying in UTM, Johor, which is only a shore apart from Singapore).

But just to come back to my present situation, mid-term exams and some assignment proposals need to be done. So I need to work hard for it :).

Ever since yesterday I got that travelling lust, I&apos;m constant dreaming that I got air tickets to the US and I&apos;m announcing the boards saying "Felix coming to the States! <3 and trying to schedule plans to visit some of the boardies. Sounds fun, although it&apos;s still kind of distant :). Hopefully I can get my dream come true!
