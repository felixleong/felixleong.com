{% mark post -%}For some reasons, I&apos;m feeling a little bit down. Not being really disappointed or depressed, just feeling down, you know, like having some sort of emotional burden in yourself.

OK, just a run-down on some possible reasons that I feel down:
- Being truthful to yourself and others can be a good thing, but pairing it with a tendency to speak without thinking too much is usually going to put you into some embarrassing situations. OK, it&apos;s that serious that really causes anyone to be upset, but it just that… well…
- The Para Para Paradise machine in Amcorp Mall (the only shopping complex nearest to me) has disappeared! I&apos;m not sure whether it is taken away temporarily for repairs, or permanently due to lack of demand. I know one of the sensors did had some problems the last time I went there (then it&apos;s okay again), but the latter has a greater possibility, since I noticed that not many people actually played that machine. I might check it out next week or so, so I better keep my fingers crossed.

On the brighter side of things, my CD-ROM has been replaced! Yahoo! Now I can rip CDs faster and watch my video CD again. That&apos;s a great thing! :D At least there&apos;s something in store for me now.{%- endmark %}
