OK, my knee&apos;s better now. Although I didn&apos;t go to the doctor… Basically I thought I was late to meet up with my friend and my cell doesn&apos;t have enough credits to make a call, so I went back home (since my knee is getting better at that time). However, unknown to me, he&apos;s searching me all over the place while I&apos;m away. :X If you are reading this, Vico, I&apos;m terribly sorry for that. =.="

Anyway, my health has taken a downturn towards the bad and I now have some muscle pain, a sore throat, a slightly running nose, and a lack of energy. Looks like my recent assignment midnight rush has made an impact on my health. Thinking about it, not only my sleeping pattern changed during that period, I have also forget to do my routine health maintenance activities such as exercising and practising a healthy diet (not to mention I forgot to drink a lot of water, darn, should had heard my mother&apos;s advice).

So here I am… feeling sick (not seriously sick, just annoying), and I have a mid-term afterwards (gosh!). I can&apos;t seem to get my last-minute reading fixed into my head… hope I&apos;ll do okay (if not worse). After that, I better force myself to take some rest and at least do some exercise afterwards. Oh… Forgot about the water as well.

Oh, by the way, I just done some sketches for my Flash assignment, <a href="http://mywebpage.netscape.com/Felix%20Leong%207/mt/">click here to view it</a>.

I still struggling with animating with Flash, so if you had any tips, you had my undivided attention.
