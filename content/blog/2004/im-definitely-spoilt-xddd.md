Living with my aunt definitely have me spoilt. I don't have to worry about utility bills (except for my phone line and my exuberant Internet charges XDDD), don't have to worry about internal squabbles with house/room mates, having a room of my ownâ€¦

And just now, I was planning to heat up my unfinished dinner yesterday, since I'm:

1. Too lazy to get out
2. Don't want to waste good food
3. Save cost XDDD

And Aunt Patricia who's living upstairs have bought dinner for me. <333 Sweet of her ^^. Guess I'm beyond being lucky? :p
