{% mark post -%}I guess it&apos;s pretty much engraved deep in my genes that I can&apos;t sleep at any time before midnight. However, on the side of the story, I&apos;m also pretty much "cursed" with my own sleeping habit that I must have at least 6 hours of sleep in order to wake up by instincts.

As much as I knew this as a fact, my ignorance got the better of me and I ended up having a nasty day for that. So the story goes when I stayed up late at night to finish up my readings summary (call it additional school work if you want). And although I know my own sleeping patterns and the early morning class the next day, yet I ignore my inner voice that I need to leave everything for tommorow.

The ending is pretty much obvious: screams, a pair of sleepy eyes, an empty stomach, constant rushing, missing the bus… and finally: late for class -_-". Luckily it&apos;s only a normal lecture, but I&apos;m not too happy when I found out that the lecturer isn&apos;t one of my favourites… (that&apos;s a over polite statement). And I have to put up with a not-so-good mood, making sure that I don&apos;t doze off, and a rusty brain.

Blah… that surely thought me a good lesson that I don&apos;t think that I would ever learn…. May you have a good night sleep today… *yawn*{%- endmark %}
