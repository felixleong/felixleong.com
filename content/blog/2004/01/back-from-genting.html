Phew, it&apos;s a long day :). I just went to Genting this afternoon and just managed to get back home on a computer.

Anyway, today is really exciting for me because today is the eGenting Programming Competition prize giving night. As much as I didn&apos;t win anything, I have learnt quite a lot during their public lecture about the questions. Not to mention they have a dinner for all participants at an expensive Chinese restaurant.

But I don&apos;t really feel like typing too much, because on my way back on the bus, the mountain road is really rough on my full stomach that makes me seasickâ€¦

Anyway, it&apos;s still fun. :)
