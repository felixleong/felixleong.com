{% mark post -%}Just went to the computer shop today to make a warranty claim for my faulty notebook CD-ROM drive and everything is fine (Thank god those support people didn&apos;t gave me a bad experience!). Anyway, the other good thing is that they allow me to take the notebook back while they get the CD-ROM for a replacement. However, they need about three weeks to replace the faulty CD-ROM since they have to bring it to the manufacturers. Therefore now I have a notebook with a gap at the CD-ROM drive bay. Dust and computers doesn&apos;t mix, so I just tape the side until I get my drive back.

Today is pretty much a happy day for me, much due to the fact that someone that I feel special is making her first attempt to make a presentation in a developers group. :) Just sweet to look at her presenting… Well… guess I&apos;ll just leave it to that. :){%- endmark %}
