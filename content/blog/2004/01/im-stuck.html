Try to imagine being stuck in a school canteen while it&apos;s raining outside… Oh my… Thank god there&apos;s a Internet connection to keep my company… but not for long, I guess, since there&apos;s thunderstorms and I won&apos;t risk my notebook for that.

Anyway, today is just another slow day… I&apos;m starting to feel that I need to get more CDs for my music collection. But my wallet is still tying me back, resisting any urge to buy more of them. I would have go for a download spree for MP3s, but I deeply believe that I need to give my favourite artist the best support that I can give. :) So… I guess that makes me a really dull boy who play by the rules.

Today is pretty much a surprise to me because I just knew that the most awaited Final Fantasy VII Piano Collections has been released last December. I was pretty much shocked by the fact that most sites didn&apos;t even post up news for this long-absent CD. (six years! And it WAS the long awaited gap to be filled for the series) Since the CD is published by Digicube, I doubt that it&apos;ll reach the Malaysian shores. But if it does, I would not hesitate to buy it.

But then again… God! I&apos;m putting myself in an imaginary dilemma here. :p Anyway, Soft-world Malaysia just brought in Falcom&apos;s Zwei!! (Chinese version), and hopefully I can grab one from the local computer shops here. (Falcom games are the best!)
