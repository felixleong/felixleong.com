OMG… I have been overspending again… but then again, my favourite CDs are pretty hard to come by, therefore I get very excited when I managed to find a shop that carries them (even if they only carried ONE of them). Originally I was planning to get my hands on some more the GTC Special 2000 CD, but to my surprise: It has been bought >_<! You can imagine how frustrated I am when I found out, since I have been hunting down Eurobeat CDs for quite some time. (Living in a country with a low currency exchange rate pretty sucks in some sense)

Thank god the move super tune -best selection- CD is still there (phew!). But while feeling a little bit disappointed, I saw Ayumi&apos;s latest album, Memorial Address, which I have been longing for quite some time. So, I&apos;m like "Oh well… at least I have something to settle with…" and I bought the CD+VCD set. (I wanted the DVD set at first, but thinking about it, I don&apos;t even have a DVD player!) On my way home, I flip through and read the lyrics of her songs. And when I read the lyrics for the first track "ANGEL&apos;S SONG", I was so touched I sobbed in the bus. Really, I do! It&apos;s the same Ayumi as we know it, that&apos;s why we love her. (She wrote the lyrics for almost every of her songs) The lyrics are so beautiful…

Reaching home, I poped the CD into my Linux machine (remembered that my notebook CD-ROM is spoilt) and the copy protection does gives me the headaches: because the Linux machine can&apos;t read the disc properly >_<! ARGH! Well… I certainly don&apos;t blame avex for that, since they have labelled it really clearly, and I have no problems ripping MP3s with their discs for my hearing pleasure. Although I do manage to listen to the CD (great CD) but I have to bear with some occasional hiccups (which is no fun, but I have no choice for now). Hopefully I&apos;m able to rip it when I get back to my home town (since I didn&apos;t find any problems when I ripped the copy-protected ayu-ro mix 3)

Well, Chinese New Year is just around the corner now, and I&apos;m pretty excited to go home now. I didn&apos;t feel too comfortable going back though because I made a lot of lies about my previous year loan application (I dare not tell the truth that I didn&apos;t send it out…), and I&apos;m really feeling terrible when I think about it… Sometimes it&apos;s really hard to tell the truth when you&apos;ve tell way too much lies… my head started to hurt right now… I guess the cover will be blown off during Chinese New Year because I&apos;m almost sure that my relatives are going to ask my mom about this (or the other way round)… Now even the disaster didn&apos;t happen (there&apos;s a possibility that that won&apos;t happen), I really feel the urge of escaping from this situation… as much I feel responsible for this, I don&apos;t know what should I do now… At this point of time, Ayumi&apos;s "No way to say" is playing in the background… the first few verses do reflect on what I&apos;m feeling right now… I&apos;m now feeling really insecure… Sometimes, keeping too much bad secrets to yourself does hurt a lot…
