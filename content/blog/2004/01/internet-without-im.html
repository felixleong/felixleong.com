Today… as usual… I&apos;m late for school… again (blah blah blah… I don&apos;t think I want to get into that crap again)

It&apos;s been quite a while since I haven&apos;t been on IM lately, originally I was thinking that the school has been outsmarting my proxy-tunnelling efforts to get into IM (for those technologically-challenged, basically that means that I use a software to connect to IM services which has been originally blocked by the school server. This can be done by having the software to act as a "tunnel"/middle-man to secretly pass those messages through. Think of it as good CIA or KGB spies).

But after a check at <a href="http://www.htthost.com/">HTTPort&apos;s</a> (the proxy tunnelling software) site, looks like there&apos;s some technical problems causing the downtime. So… Well… guess no IM at school for a few more days.

As school continues, it seems that the future workload during my course is going to really heavy and intimidating. My database subject requires us to find a third party who might benefit from a system and we are expected to have some interviews and presentations. Just by the thought of it sounds scary. Hopefully I can manage this, my self-confidence is pretty much shaky right now.

On the other hand, for my multimedia technology subject, we are require to create a Flash movie. It does sounds a lot of fun, currently I&apos;m thinking of ideas between my own anime trailer and a Para Para animated Flash movie! ^_^ I might be doing the latter, it would really be cool when I show it to others :D.

Well… so much for another day at school. Currently I&apos;m just feeling a little bit annoyed by the fact that sometimes people will only call you "friends" when there are some form of benefits in store for them. As much as I accept that and didn&apos;t take it too personally, when this happens I can&apos;t help but feeling something fuming deep inside me…
