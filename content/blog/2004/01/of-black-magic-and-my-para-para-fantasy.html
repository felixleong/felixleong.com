Yes! Tommy and I (and a few more members) are going to form our own Para Para group soon! ^_^ Our team name will tentatively be called My Para Para Fantasy. The "MY" part is really fun because it&apos;s also the country code for Malaysia :D. Hopefully everything would go well and we get more Paralist down here in South East Asia.

Oh yeah, I&apos;m feeling a little bit better now and I just film <a href="http://felixleong.freewebsites.com/videos/blackmagic.wmv">Black Magic</a> (choreograph: velfarre). Go ahead and download it!

*Yawn* Gotta get some sleep. Ja&apos;ne!
