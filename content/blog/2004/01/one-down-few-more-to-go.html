{% mark post -%}Phew! Finally I got my copy of important documents certified by a police officer (it doesn&apos;t look as scary as I last went), have my loan forms filled in nicely, and submit it to the Student Affairs Department! Woo-hoo~ I suddenly feel a surge of accomplishment today, just hope that everything will go on smoothly after that. :D

Anyway, with one task finished, there&apos;s more awaiting me to finish tomorrow. Basically I need to contact the computer shop tomorrow and ask whether my CD-ROM is back, get out there and lend some CDs, and organize a small outing with my developer groups. The former two is pretty much simple, but the last one is the one which is making me a little nervous since the confirmed attendance doesn&apos;t look too good (therefore I&apos;m not even sure how many people going to attend tomorrow). Just hope that tomorrow&apos;s will turn out to be successful.

Wellâ€¦ back into working mode, there&apos;s just way too much school work yet to be done.{%- endmark %}
