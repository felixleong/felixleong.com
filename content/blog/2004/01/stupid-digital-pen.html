After an exhausting day at the arcades, I still have to force myself to work some things out (especially school work X( ). It appears that the digital pen is still not working… ARRRGGH~~ I have been trying to nail down the problem down but failed miserably, and it&apos;s pretty funny that Windows XP can detect the pen yet the provided software didn&apos;t notice it. I wonder…

I just sent a mail to tech support, hopefully it&apos;ll get replied soon, otherwise I can&apos;t do anything for the research project.

Anyway, Almond just posted up a good Ayu-quiz link, check out my friend page and try it out. :) Here&apos;s my results:
