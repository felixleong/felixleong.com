I got myself SEB presents ayu-ro mix 2 (phew! That&apos;s hard to find), and I just popped-in the CD and having myself instantly liked it. I was totally blown away when I listen to the first track AUDIENCE (Euro-Power Mix), and hearing that upbeat and lively rhythm had really forget about the fatigue. (after the TechNET event during the day)

Flipping through the lyrics translation that came with the CD, it really surprised me the lyrics is about friendship. I can&apos;t recall the lyrics as I don&apos;t have it by my side at school, but it really put me into some deep thought when it comes to this matter.

Sometimes I just can&apos;t stop by thinking whether friends are necessity in life, or is it just something that is external in life? As much as everyone is not an "I"-land, but most people are cursed by the genes of protecting themselves in order to protect their best interests. Whether this is a good thing or not, I&apos;m not too sure --- since everything has more than one view (well… we live in a 3D space anyway)

I wonder whether I&apos;m blinded by my own rationality, instincts and senses. Sometimes real friends are really hard to find, or it&apos;s not obvious without careful observations. Sometimes when you see everyone around ignoring you unless there something that they need your help, it&apos;s hard not to get depressed when taking it personally. Sometimes just to protect yourself, you have to mask out your true self…

Guess I&apos;m just doing some random babbling, but my thought are really disorganized that I can&apos;t really see what&apos;s around me. I hate feeling lost, yet I have to reassure myself and try to find my way through it. I hate feeling alone, yet I hate to be crowded as well… Sometimes when we try to find balance, yet balance can also be achieved by controlling imbalances… It&apos;s just confusing…

Now, sitting down in an empty classroom, it seems that memories are starting to roll in my head, mixed with a cocktail of emotions… there&apos;s a feeling of emptiness, yet it doesn&apos;t seems to be like it… Everything is flowing around me, yet I can&apos;t see it… … … … …
