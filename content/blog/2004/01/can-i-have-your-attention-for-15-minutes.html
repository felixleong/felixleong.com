{% mark post -%}Oh my god… my classes are starting to act like crap now… even the class announcements is taking 15 minutes of our time! Oh great… Guess that the problem of having too much public holidays. (class replacements isn&apos;t totally fun, since there&apos;s a tendency for our lecturers to rush the lectures for the sake of finishing the syllabus) And having 7 subjects doesn&apos;t help in relieving any stress (homework and assignments and readings and exams… *goes on and rant endlessly*

Well… things just happen to me lately: being stuck in a heavy downpour yesterday, noticed that there&apos;s a hole under my shoe, having 5 books to be returned tomorrow, an untidy room… I really hate to rant every single thing in my life, as I usually like to see the bright side of things, but when these small problems become overwhelming, I can&apos;t help but to find some way to vent my frustrations. (Thank god I didn&apos;t take the liking of committing violence on anything :p)

Perhaps I do have to get my life a little bit more organized… *stare at the pile of books next to me while listening to class*{%- endmark %}
