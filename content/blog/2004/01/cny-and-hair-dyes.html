Here I am, back in my aunt&apos;s place again, waiting to go to school tomorrow. Anyway, my Chinese New Year celebrations are pretty fun… well, there might be some disappointments here and there, but overall it&apos;s still fun. Anyway, here&apos;s a list of fun and not-so-fun stuff I encountered:
<b>Fun</b> (In no particular order)
- Angpows!!! (= Money)
- Gathering with best friends
- Mahjongg (Fun fun fun!)
- Class party with surprise guest (old classmates from overseas! Wee!)
- Lunch, snacks, cookies and what not


<b>Not-so-Fun</b>
- Sick! (due to lack of sleep) and…
- An upset stomach throughout (Darn! Why does it have to be before my class party!)
- Class party with no interesting group/gossip to slot in X(
- Loans and constant nagging [refer to my previous entries]… (at least I got my documents prepared… I just need to get them certified)

I got my hair dyed today, but my first attempts are like… well… I mess up almost the whole place XD. And since I got dark hair, the blackcurrant colour doesn&apos;t seem to show or shine even (well… at least under florescence light). Guess I have to leave it that way and see whether anyone noticed. :p Oh… I did got a haircut as well let see whether I can post up a pic next time.

Well… guess I stop here now, my computer has been hanging on me for 4 times already, I dare not risk it again :). By the way, I&apos;m feeling a little… well… fuzzy. Sometimes, having some fuzzy feeling towards others is like a blessing and a curse… sometimes I just feel that I can&apos;t bring enough courage to confront the responsibilities in life, yet I have to do something about it. Most of the time, I just feel weak and helpless, yet I have to bring myself to confront an enemy which is so small, yet so big in illusion…
