Phew… finally, a week over :).

Anyway, the good thing about participating in university research groups is that you might get a chance to try those new gadgets in the market. This time we get to have our hands on <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/usertype/businesstopics&CRID=1912&parentCRID=267&contentID=7333&countryid=34&languageid=1">Logitech&apos;s ioPen</a> for our research. :D It might not sound cool compared to those gadgets in MIT or Carnegie Melon, but at least for gadget deprived people like me, that&apos;s something cool enough! :D

However, there are some frustration that kicks in: My laptop doesn&apos;t seem to detect the digital pen! Gah… guess I&apos;m still trying to figure it out what&apos;s wrong with my computer settings (cause it works in my professor&apos;s computer).

Work is starting to pile up and I&apos;m starting to shift some gears now! Till then, I&apos;m wishing the best of luck for myself.
