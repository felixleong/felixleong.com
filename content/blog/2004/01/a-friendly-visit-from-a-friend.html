Well… nothing much happened on the first day of school after Chinese New Year. However the festivities does made me really lazy… not a really good sign. For some reasons, I&apos;m not feeling energetic like I used to be, I wonder whether I wanted to blame my diet, my sleeping patterns, or a weary soul. (My parents would have said the former two)

I did get a surprise today though, one of my forum friends just came to pay me a visit… not really with that intention, he&apos;s actually coming to our university to have a look around, since his sister is considering to study in our university. So far everything is good, but of course he is expecting a bigger campus but he&apos;s in for some disappointment. Well… but so far so good for a new university like ours.

Oh yeah… I think I blew it this time (OK, it&apos;s not that serious), I guess more and more people are starting to know my special interest of mine. And I have YET to gain the courage to tell her personally. And maybe it&apos;s just me, but I started to notice some of the flip side of her (as the saying goes, no one&apos;s perfect, dear)… Oh my… I wonder is this a good thing or bad… :p
