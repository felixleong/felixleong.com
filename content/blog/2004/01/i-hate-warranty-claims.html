I woke up without any improvement with my mood, and even worse, the notebook CD-ROM is indeed facing some problems in reading any CDs! Duh… That certainly has spoil my day, but it might have been a dirty lens instead, so I guess I might go out and pick up a cleaner for that. Personally I wouldn&apos;t want to make warranty claim unless it&apos;s really necessary… tech support somewhat give me the creeps sometime.

Well… at least school did occupy me with work instead of depressing thoughts, so I guess school isn&apos;t that bad after all, in that sense, that is. :p
