Only manage to catch two hours of sleep today… umm… yesterday. Programming assignments can be quite evil sometimes x\_x".

Anyway, I'm going on with my daily live today feeling all tired, not completely, just that you feel that the energy is slipping away once in a while. Worse, I can't believe that I slept in my Entrepreneurial Skill tutorial class (GOSH! Bad timing!). My iPod is getting quite some attention today, which is quite cool but anyway, things are fun with Choon Hui back in class, I do really want to tell him how much I missed him these days… but I just decided to hold it back until I think it's the right time. I just feel some gut feeling that it's going to be close, I just don't know when. Guess my instincts will be able to give me some sort of indication… and I'm know that I will expect the outcome will be. I just hope that it's not going to be worse.

During our Interpersonal Communication lecture, Ms Nicole has been spending one hour recalling the memories of her first love. And yeah, she's right that we are paying our 110% attention and concentration on what she's saying.

And for some reasons, I just happen to come … so close to a point of crying, since I'm really able to relate myself to her story.

Well… as much as mine wasn't the same experience as hers, since mine was pretty much a one-sided kind of first love: I just fell for somebody who already has a partner.

I still remembered the time when I can really sacrifice myself… perhaps to a point that I just happen to hurt myself in the process: Expecting something in return which I won't get; expecting a love which will not be mine; expecting that the feeling will fade away instead of drilling deeper deep down…

So it just happens that my self-confidence are starting to chip away: piece by piece, my heart being shattered: surface by surface, feeling drowned in the sea of depression: deeper and deeper… At that time, my destructive thoughts are starting to take away my happiness and my purpose in life. I just know that I have to put it to a fullstop and shove it away, but everytime… the feeling is like the Pandora's Box: always tempting me to open it, which I ended up losing the battle: hurting myself all over again.

This only ended when I confessed my feelings for the second time, but the response I get is a sore attempt to drift the topic away… And it ended with me scarred really badly…

…
Bleh, flashbacks.

Other than that, got more assignments to worry about, but I'm basically OK.
