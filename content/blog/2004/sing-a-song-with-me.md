Today's a pretty fun day with my friends :), and it's pretty exciting as Steven mentioned that there's a special guest named Jenny today. OK, before this, actually Steven asked me and a few friends of mine to go to a karaoke lounge, and so I agree to go (as much as my budget doesn't allow me to… I'm bad :p).

And so… Damn I'm late :p. But yeah I do get a suprise, because the "Jenny" that Steven mentioned is actually Jacob, one of my best friends during college. (w00t!!! :D) It's been quite a while I haven't seen him, and I can only say that he didn't changed much ever since I knew him. And not to mention that Erika, Soo Hoo, Rachael and a few others joined in the fun. So we do have a great time. If there's any regrets, the karaoke lounge *does* have Ayumi Hamasaki songs and AAAAH~ I should have at least learn how to sing a few of them >.<" (ANGEL'S SONG and M, in particular). I guess we might have another chance next time :).

Then later on we went to Time Square (one of the shopping malls that I frequent) and the fun doesn't stop there. Of course, Steven and the gang is pretty much setting up times where Erika and I was left alone. And GOD I'm embarrassed, not to mention that I have **totally NO idea** what to do since it is considered our first date. And later on it just so happens that I have been through some odd blunders :p, and Steven just keep on dropping pointers on how to be romantic and stuff. Oh god… I never knew it was that hard in the first place.

Anyway, just reached home, relaxing (actually I shouldn't be since I do have assignments to rush). And tomorrow will be a brand new week for school… and work.
