This morning I woke up with a totally crappy mood when I got a SMS from SMS.ac saying that RM5 is deducted from my mobile phone credit and I'm like "WTF!!!" (OK, 5 bucks isn't really something to yell about, but having it deducted three times in a row within one month is NOT funny!) I thought that I would do a complaint afterwards, so I just went to school, grumbling.

As I was walking to school, it seems that bad mood always goes with bad luck. Err… not really bad luck, but it seems that when you are grumpy, everything seems crappy, especially your group's assignments. Not to mention that it seems that the wireless Internet facility has been disabled (or temporarily down) in the other block where I'm having classes. Gah! I really feel like biting someone's head off!

After the stupid ordeal (boring classes and really annoying lecturers… but I'm still pretty much biased for the time being), I finally get online and checked with SMS.ac and suddenly I noticed two things:

1. I reopted the auto-credit feature last time just to get a few free credits during my "no-phone-credit" period.
2. THOSE HOROSCOPE AND JOKES SMS THINGY THAT THEY SENT COSTS MONEY!!! (grr… should have read the fine print)

Then, there goes my opportunity to complain… But at least I knew what happened. So, I guess I just wait until my credits run dry and I'll just unsubscribe it as soon as possible.

Darn I'm feeling like using profanity in my speech.

- I finally found the reference where Deshy mention about the bestiality joke in RPGamer boards. It's sooo lame it funny to the max (read: replies XD).
