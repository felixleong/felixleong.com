So… I got some new CDs: hitomi's thermo plastic & Final Fantasy X-2's OST :). I break one rule though: Because my principle is that I don't listen to any game music that I have never played before. But… since it's hard for me to find game music CDs anyway (stupid Digicube for not exporting game music ;\_\_\_;, and I SWEAR that I'm not going to buy another bootleg anymore), and so I bought it :3.

Anyway, I haven't listened to them both yet XDDD. Well… at least not the whole CD :p. Hitomi's style seems to remind me of the main vocalist in globe (forget the name), but first impression wise… well… I still need some time listening this CD a few more times. But… I really love Koda Kumi's 1000 Words <333, it's not the type which will catch your attention instantly, but the more you listen to it… the more it grows in me.

The lyrics… are so beautiful… Here's a portion of it (mainly the chorus): [And yeah I did the translation from the translated Chinese lyrics card contained in the overseas version of the CD]

> "I will come back"
> 
> Your voice have passed from me
> Voice having the sense of stubbornness
> Acting to be strong
> If I were to go back in time
> Should I be shouting loudly?
> Should I be crying to ask you to stay?
> If it were to be who I am now, I'll be able to do it
> No matter what it takes
> 
> All that I'm unable to voice out
> The thousand words
> I give it all to you
> Your back from afar
> Will transform into your wings
> 
> All that I'm unable to voice out
> The thousand words
> I give it all to you
> Holding
> Your wounded back
> Hugging you tight…"

God… I wished that I owned a PS2. Ah well. I didn't even own a PS as well ;\_\_\_;. Nu… I wanna play the newer Final Fantasies~ (9 onwards)

Anyway… been drifting my thoughts away with Ahmed and Erika today. I always… feel a bit scared, because most of the people around me wouldn't want to hear all the long winded stuff… It's seems like they really don't like to be dragged into my own never-never land. But somehow… guess my perceptions towards the people around me aren't entirely accurate… because… it seems that… both Ahmed and Erika listened to all my drifting thoughts, and beared with me during long moments of silence while I collect my own words and thoughts. I don't know whether it's only today, or is it that all the while I have been terribly mistaken… But… I suppose it has to be the latter, because they are the only people whom I know would listen to me drifting away… in a sea of uncollected thoughts.

And that gave me a chance… to see things much more clearly.

Taking it on a lighter note, I still remembered the time when Ahmed called me a siren XDDD… Well… guess I am, considering what have I done to Erika these few days XDDDD.

Anyway, my relationship status is not THE END by the way, I have to thank Erika for the phone call because I would have drive myself nuts if I were to think too much about the shock I had XD. But… I look at it as a time-out period and revert our status to friends for now, so that it'll be much more easier to understand each other instead of cracking our heads and figuring out how to work it out (which is… more of a disaster to me XDDD). But yeah, I made a promise with Erika today that I'll make sure I'll be happy, I hope she does the same as well :3.

I believe… when the time comes, life will take its own course. And I just hope that things will turn for the better :).

…

AHHHH~~~!!! I'm procrastinating with my alternate cover designs again XDDDD. (Or should I say… I wasted the whole day typing LJ entries XDDDD) Guess less sleep for me today. :p

p/s: For a portion of the conversation I had with Ahmed, it's in his journal [here](http://www.livejournal.com/users/Ahmed/332762.html#cutid4)
