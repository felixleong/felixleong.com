Hmm… just to keep things short:

- One of my aunt came to my university to apply for a position as library staff. Hmm, I wish her luck!
- My cousin, Chun Jin, just came back from India… and I NEVER knew he went there to study medicine o\_O"
- Got myself J-Pop Meets Classics HARMONY Ayumi Hamasaki Melody, expecting another remix album from Ayumi Hamasaki, which I'm correct except for one thing: There's no ayu vocal XDDD. It's a total classical arranged album. But then the music is beautifully arranged. Quite a nice CD to have ^^.

That should be about it.
