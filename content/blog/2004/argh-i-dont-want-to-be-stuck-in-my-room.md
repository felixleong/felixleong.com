Guess what happens when you have to study in your own room for hours… and all you are facing is four walls and a bunch of math equations? Duh…

Escape from "prison" for a while for lunch, then went to the bookshop for a stroll. For some reasons I had the kick of getting books on typography or perhaps desktop publishing, but I can't seem to find one there. So I got myself a word activator instead. Guess my creative kick needs a fix.

Well… gotta hit the books again.
