Basically we did the same presentation like we did on Friday, only that this time I'm doing it in my class. My presentation is great, at least I'm much more confident this time since I'm much more prepared ^^. And I get positive response with my "pen throwing" stint. Well, I'm trying to emphasizing the point that we can't separate ourselves with pen and paper in the digital age, so my line is like "However, we can't just throw our pen *throws the pen away, hearing that it hit the ceilingâ€¦ hard* and change the way we use to store information".

I'm just happy that people are enjoying it ^^.

I'm going to Putrajaya to attend Microsoft Innovation Day tomorrow. Heard that Bill Gates is coming, so cool! <333 Downside: Choon Hui's not coming. But I'm sure that I'll be able to enjoy myself there ^^.
