Let's see, nothing much today, just went for today's gathering, and I just made an exception to my usual dress code: I opted for an all black look, with a Matrix Revolutions tee, a black shimmering Bum jeans… and even a black undie to match the whole thing XD. Too bad my hanky (to swipe of any sweat during heavy dancing) is pink, LOL.

Then when I shuffle through my wardrobe, I only noticed that the moth and mould balls gets used up… Ugh, that's what I really hated to do, because the so-called "fragrance" of these things are so strong that I would have consider them as a really nasty stench. So I take a deep breath… hold it… opened the plastic bag containing those little packets of moth pills (which smells like unmatching and fake perfume on someone who don't know how to test a perfume), quickly throw it in the closet, and hastily seal the plastic bag with tape. Phew… I just hate them, not to mention that they made me feel dizzy.

Then just before I go the gathering, I check the CD shop for any releases… and I just happen to stumble with MAXIMUM GROOVE! OMG! That's the CD that contains the cover of my current Eurobeat tune: Don't You Love Me by Virginelle! Augh! And I had spent the money to get the Spirited Away Soundtrack yesterday! As much as I really feel the urge to get it, I hesitated… and put it back on the shelf. I think I need the money which I have kept now, besides, I need to save some during the Penang trip. Oh well, I think I might get it next month.

Then during the gathering I met Clon (hope I didn't get the name/person wrong… XD) for the first time, and oh, he's really cool with Pump It Up! :) Didn't get to chat with him, but I suppose I might meet him next time. I slightly change my dance style a bit, making myself a little bit more bouncy than usual. And my that felt good ^^. Then we went to visit A Kuei at the restaurant which he is working now (hmm… in fact it is his father's restaurant), I can see his eyes glitter when I showed him my Para Para Paradise CD collection and the J-Euro DVD. Hope he didn't see it like I'm showing off or anything XD. (I don't really feel like lending my collection to anyone… well, those which I don't really know well anyway :p)

Now I'm at home, feeling quite exhausted. I have a few of things to do: updating MYPPF's website, finding any motels in Penang. (God! If we can't some place to stay, we have to postpone the trip), draw some pixel arts for the job application, possibly studying my differentiation and integrations (to prepare my soon-to-be failed math paper). Hmm… other than that… *snap!* Augh! My back! XD

[:: Random Events ::]

Oh! I tried to romanized the lyrics for Always with Me, hope I got it correct :p (Looks like I really have to learn my Japanese a bit better… I'm still stuck at beginners level :p).

**木村　弓：いつも何度でも**

呼んでいる　胸のどこか奥で  
いつも心踊る　夢を見たい

かなしみは　数えきれないけれど  
その向こうできっと　あなたに会える

繰り返すあやまちの　そのたび　ひとは  
ただ青い空の　青さを知る  
果たしなく　道は続いて見えるけれど  
この両手は　光を抱ける

さよならのときの　静かな胸  
ゼロになるからだが　耳をすませる

生きでいる不思議　死んでいく不思議  
花も風も街も　みんなおなじ


呼んでいる　胸のどこか奥で  
いつも何度でも　夢を描こう

かなしみの数を　言い尽くすより  
同じくちびるで　そっとうたおう

閉じていく思い出の　そのなかにいつも  
忘れたくない　ささやきを聞く  
こなごなに砕かれた　鏡の上にも  
新しい景色が　映される

はじまりの朝の　静かな窓  
ゼロになるからだ　充（満）たされてゆけ

海の彼方には　もう探さない  
輝くものは　いつもここに  
わたしのなかに　見つけられたから

Youmi Kimura: Itsumo Nando Demo (Always with Me)


Yonde iru, Mune no doko ka okude  
Itsumo kokoro odoru, Yume o mitai

Kanashi miwa, Kazoeki renai keredo  
Sono mukou de kitto, Anata ni aeru

Kurikaesu ayamachi no, Sono tabi, Hito wa  
Tada aoi sora no, Aosa o shiru  
Hatashi naku, Michi wa tsuzuite mitaeru keredo  
Kono ryoute wa, Hikari o dakeru

Sayonara no toki no, Shizukana mune  
Zero ni naru kara da ga, Mimi o sumaseru

Iki de iru fushigi, Shin de iku fushigi  
Hana mo kaze mo machi mo, Minna onaji


Yonde iru, Mune no doko ka okude  
Itsumo nando demo, Yume o egakou

Kanashimi no kazu o, Ii tsukusu yori  
Onaji kuchibiru de, Sottou Taou

Tojiteiku omoideno, Sono naka ni itsumo  
Wasuretakunai, Sasayaki o kiku

Konagona ni kodakareta, Kagami no ue ni mo  
Atarashi keshiki ga, Utsusareru

Hajimari no asa no, Shizukana Mado  
Zero ni naru kara da, Mita sareteyuke

Umi no kanata ni wa, Mou sagasanai  
Kagayaku mono wa, Itsumo koko ni  
Watashi no naka ni, Mitsukerareta kara

Do comment if I made any mistakes. Thanks!
