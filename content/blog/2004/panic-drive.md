Anyone needs a guess why I put this journal title again? :p Some habits are just that hard to improve.

Walking in the rain isn't totally fun, especially when you need to walk for about 30 minutes in the rain (in total). Other than that, wellâ€¦ life's pretty much normal. Although I do hate when Alfred keeps on piling stuff on my table to read (as if I'll be able to magically make those code examples work together as a totally working and perfect program in one second).

Anyway, guess I should be back to work now. Ja 'ne!
