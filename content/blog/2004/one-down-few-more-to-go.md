Phew! Finally I got my copy of important documents certified by a police officer (it doesn't look as scary as I last went), have my loan forms filled in nicely, and submit it to the Student Affairs Department! Woo-hoo~ I suddenly feel a surge of accomplishment today, just hope that everything will go on smoothly after that. :D

Anyway, with one task finished, there's more awaiting me to finish tomorrow. Basically I need to contact the computer shop tomorrow and ask whether my CD-ROM is back, get out there and lend some CDs, and organize a small outing with my developer groups. The former two is pretty much simple, but the last one is the one which is making me a little nervous since the confirmed attendance doesn't look too good (therefore I'm not even sure how many people going to attend tomorrow). Just hope that tomorrow's will turn out to be successful.

Wellâ€¦ back into working mode, there's just way too much school work yet to be done.
