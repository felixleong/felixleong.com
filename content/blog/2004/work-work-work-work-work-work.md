Been staying in the lab for hours @\_@". Ugh… which is OK since at least I get a decent Internet connection here, it's kinda noisy though, but that's OK until my iPod ran out of juice.

Flashing back, yesterday have been a really bad day for me. Everything just doesn't work out… and as small those matters can be, the disappointment is so depressing that I really feel like a failure, and feeling like a total failure sucks. Just feeling all energy, motivation and passion being drained to a point that everything is not worth doing. I really feel like crying, it's really that depressing, but I just can't get my tears out no matter how hard I tried.

For some reasons, one of Coach Vee's comment just flashes into my mind *"Everything happens for a reason"*. That kept me pondering for some time… that's pretty much what happened before I had my early night sleep.

Then, about 12 hours later, and add another 7 hours, I'm still here, working on those codes which is due tomorrow. Been in deep thoughts about human inequality, but that's for later. For now… work work work work work work work *in endless loop*….

[p/s: Thanks for the hugs, *hugs back ^^*. That really made my morning today]
