Finally, today's the day when we as loan applicants have to fill in the final paperwork in order to get the cash in our banks. Waking up 7 in the morning, it's pretty much exciting because I finally can assure myself that I don't need to be nagged my mom for that. Then off I go to school, feeling that everything will be pretty much simple and painless… well… almost.

As soon as I reached school, I was shocked to see that the venue is packed! Apparently all loan applicants decided to get an early start on things and I'm pretty much squished between the crowd. My favourite "Sardines in a tin" metaphor still stays true up to this day :p. By that amount of people gathering over here, it's pretty much evident my initial expectation is going down the drain and I can expect some small ripples of chaos (as usual).

Then things didn't turn out that smoothly: long queues, heaty atmosphere, noisy crowd… that somewhat made me a little bit dizzy. And then… wha…? I'm expected to bring my bank passbook! FUDGE! They never told us THAT in their notice! And my house is so darn far away that I'm too lazy to get it. Thank god the bank officials are there to allow us to open new savings accounts, and I opened *another* savings account, hoping that it'll make my life easier.

And NOOO~ I was expected to fill in the bank account number before I submit my paperwork! So I was to told to check things at 3. Fine by me, since I've classes before that and I can do with some lunch. So I waited… and when I enquire them: The passbook hadn't arrived yet! I'm starting to get nervous at that point that I had that nervous energy explode inside me that those little voice inside is telling me that I'm going to screw things up!

Ah the panic! So I have been waiting at the hall until 4 and the officials are going to leave. As much as the Student Affairs Department reassure us that we can hand the stuff up on next Monday, I can't seem to calm myself down, most probably due to the fact that I wanted it to be done today. Luckily my wish is granted and the passbook is handed to me on 4:30p.m. and with my paperwork leaving with them later on.

Phew! That's another small, insignificant adventure for me. I wonder what's next? Repaying the loans? :p
