Ah! It's almost a month after we started our semester and it's a good time to have the ball rolling all over. Yes, assignments are starting to snowball on us and I'm no less of being anywhere from less panic…. OK… I think I'm over reacting on my part, but then I just can't help it and I always can't take things less seriously (which is what my friends has been telling me throughout these years) ^^".

Maybe I do need to improve myself on that.

Other than that, borrowed a few more book for my final year project, and I'm surprised that YesAsia took my Visa Electron card! That's going to be awesome! ^^ Can't wait for my PPP VCDs in the mail ^^v. And yeah… the school Internet is being all sucky all of a sudden, ARGH!!! *kill kill kill*
