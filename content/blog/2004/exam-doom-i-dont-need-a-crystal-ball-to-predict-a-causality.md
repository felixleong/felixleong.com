title: Exam Doom: I Don't Need A Crystal Ball To Predict A Causality

First ever flunk in my life… that's what I feel right now. Never once I had ever failed a paper (although I do experience a close call during high school). The maths paper today looks easy yet I'm unable to answer it. And even if I passed, a D on my slip wouldn't look nice either (God! Fail me instead!). And I'm getting all disappointed as soon as the examiner says "Times up!", and I'm really like crying out loud just after I walked out of the hall.

But… no, that didn't happen. I'm still putting up a "stressed (or maybe disappointed or defeat)-but-everything's-still-OK" face instead… Is it I'm becoming stronger? Not really, I'm still feeling like crying and finding someone to hug deep inside. As much as I hate it, I'm still holding back my sadness and swallow every single tear as soon as they reach my throat. I can't really explain… the best way I can really put it is that I don't really entrust my sad and vulnerable feelings to others. Even though I had a friend staying over here right now, I don't even feel like pouring out to him (not to mention he's not that huggable… umm… maybe it's only me being picky). And as soon as I reach home reassuring that I'll have some private space to do so, my aunt from my hometown just happens to drop by, with a family of her friend with her. That makes me feel that my sadness are trapped in the middle of nowhere… unable to find some form of escape and ventilation.

Sometimes I just hope that there's someone whom I can feel really comfortable and totally vulnerable when needed… but most of them are so far away, either physically or emotionally.

In other news, there's only three more papers and two more days till exam ends. There's two papers tomorrow: Moral and Ethics and Multimedia Technology. I'm aiming to get an A for my MT paper so that I can patch the loss of other subjects (especially today's paper). But with the mood I'm in now… Just hope everything goes well…
