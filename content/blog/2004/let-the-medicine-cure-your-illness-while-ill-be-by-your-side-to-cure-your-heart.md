Considering how I was treated while I'm extremely sickly when I was a kid, I couldn't bear the worries I had when Erika felt weak today.

Anyway, now I'm at home, savouring some great music :3. Homework has yet to be done, but I suppose I better give myself some whipping to start things up a little XDDD.

Anyway, I was feeling like learning this song. This has to be one of my favourite Ayumi Hamasaki song, so I just feel like posting the lyrics (translated one, taken down from [Divine Ayu](http://ayumi.primenova.com/lyrics.php)).

## M / Ayumi Hamasaki

"Maria" There is someone I should love;
every person who has ever been hurtâ€¦

As I look around,
everyone busily
hurries on by.

I noticed that this year, too,
the signs of winter have
come very soon.

Again, somewhere in this city today
two people will meet and fall in love;
the curtains are violently opened.

Even so, everything eventually,
someday, has an end.

Again, somewhere in this city today
two people split apart;
the curtains are quitely dropped.

"Maria" There is someone I should love.
At times I feel very lonely.
But my needs are all filled
by the person I should love.


"Maria" There is someone I should love.
At times I bear very deep wounds.
But my they are all healed
by the person I should love.

There, I'm off for school work :p
