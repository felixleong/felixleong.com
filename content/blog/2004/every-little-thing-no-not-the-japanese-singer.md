Nothing much happened except for the same ol' rant list I post up previously. However, just after yesterday's thoughts, I woke up in the morning feeling some sort of feeling like my heart is being exposed: Just a kind of feeling that you just feel insecure, a feeling that you are in the position of being vulnerable.

Wellâ€¦. that pretty much wear off when the frustration kicks in, stupid rant list (refer back to the previous few entries). Worse, the turnout for our Computer Society's AGM is extremely disappointing: only 8 members turns up, and add some drama to spice things up a little. And I always have that brain overloading sensation when I got stressed out, which is not fun since I have to seclude myself for a while in order to let myself cool down a little. Gah! I'm just one control freak >\_<".

I just wish that things will get settled soon >.>.
