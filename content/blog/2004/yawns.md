Assignment is taking a toll… But then the bigger problem is my procrastination habit x\_x". Deadlines are all lined up on the Friday the 13th… Umm… o\_o", well, I have faith that things will go good anyway, minus good sleep.

What else… yeah, just feel somewhat unenthusiastic in everything today, I don't know why. Perhaps I just feel all transparent today from people, and whenever I'm not transparent, the topic only revolves around assignments x\_x". I really need some sort of life back…

Things got better when I manage to chill with Choon Hui, as much as he has been around with his group mates discussing about assignments. Seeing him smile always makes my day, But later on… when I was in my Entrepreneur Skills tutorial class, my tutor caught me sleeping in class x\_x". Oh god… Thank god he didn't condemn me or anything, but then I hope that it won't affect my assignment marks =.=".

eBay is so addictive that I really need to find some sort of self control, guess let's see whether I won this bid (then I have to put eBay away from my browsing list until September). Still waiting for my ayu-ro mix CD, hopefully it'll reach here soon.

I'm planning to get a cheap digicam soon, so to compensate for the death of my webcam. Just hope that I can get it for around RM200-300-ish, and it MUST support filming as well ^^. Ah… just a bunch of material stuff to look forward to.
