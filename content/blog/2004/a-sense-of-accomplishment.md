Finally I got that stupid programming bug out. Phew… that's a really tough one to weed x\_x".

Anyway… currently I'm not feeling entirely well today, my head somewhat hurts a bit. A sign of minor illnesses, hoo hoo hoo… Guess that means that I need to keep tabs with my own well being.

More work awaits me to do… and honestly I feel overwhelmed x\_x". Bleh… *doing it one at a time, tra la la~ :p*

Let me just do more artwork now.
