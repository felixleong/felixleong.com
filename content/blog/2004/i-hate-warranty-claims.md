I woke up without any improvement with my mood, and even worse, the notebook CD-ROM is indeed facing some problems in reading any CDs! Duh… That certainly has spoil my day, but it might have been a dirty lens instead, so I guess I might go out and pick up a cleaner for that. Personally I wouldn't want to make warranty claim unless it's really necessary… tech support somewhat give me the creeps sometime.

Well… at least school did occupy me with work instead of depressing thoughts, so I guess school isn't that bad after all, in that sense, that is. :p
