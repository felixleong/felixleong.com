First off… HAPPY BIRTHDAY keii!!! ^^

Anyway, just went to the Para gathering today, and I hate to say that I'm starting to suck in terms of scores ^^". I'm trying some new Para style, which might be part of the reason ^^". And I can't believe that I suck in Pump It Up! Duh!

Met with Eric for the first time, who is a paralist from Kedah. And GOD he was good <333. He have the fluid body movements of the likes of a combination of Richie and Ryoko. Cool! Hopefully we get to see him next time round and practice with him, and I got one guy who finally know more dances than most of the members :p. (so I don't need to feel fed up with the same set of songs)

I kinda miss people in general since yesterday. Been thinking quite a lot of things lately about myself, you know, life, problems, things that I should have done/known better. Stuff like that. And I just came to think of Choon Hui, I'm pretty much lost when I thought about him: He's a really fantastic friend, but I want him as someone more than that. But I might run into a risk that he might avoid me once he knows my sexuality and stuff, which is the worst senario that I don't want, as well as the biggest risk I have to take in case I want to pour it out. I don't want that to happen considering that… he's one of the best friends that I ever had.

I'm thinking of taking Coach Vee's advice earlier and pose the question indirectly. Thinking of doing it tomorrow, but if he had already sensed my attraction towards him, the message would be *really* direct (no matter how hard I try to mask it), which in turn would trigger the risk factor.

God I'm confused… Just hope for the best tomorrow.
