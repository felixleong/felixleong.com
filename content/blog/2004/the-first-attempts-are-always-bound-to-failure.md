All of a sudden my determination is running down the drains… Maybe I expect too much… that things will turn better overnight. But it seems that it's pretty much Utopian to believe in that. As much as I understand that changes in life, perspective and action would take a little time to show its effect… It's just that… I just feel like I'm seeing myself going around in the same cycle over and over again. I really don't want to go through all this again: It's really painful and I swear that I don't want to get back into deep depression.

Anyway… I'm still adjusting to the changes that happen around me. Hopefully I can get through all this.
