Feel kinda blue-ish today when I just feel the quality human interaction is kinda missing somewhere.

Anyway, my procrastination have definitely take its toll today, my Object Oriented Programming Technique assignment is pretty much stringed together hastily. Well… at least the group consist of friends who are friends of Erika. And I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN earlier that Choon Hui is really keen in having me in his group >.<". *stabs self endlessly* But then, he has his own usual gang of group members, and since he's the top student in class, I doubt ANYONE would want to let him go. ;\_\_\_\_; *sobs*

But negative thoughts aside, I'm really excited and looking forward for tomorrow: *I got a date with Choon Hui tomorrow <3333!* OK, maybe not, I only managed to ask him out to the bookstores tomorrow :3, but I'm really excited about it ^^. And to add some icing on top:

- If another friend is not joining us, I'll be spending quality time with Choon Hui alone *muah!*
- Might be going there with Choon Hui's motorbike (Talk about up close and personal there <333)

In other news, I finally finish with the choreograph of Heart Attack <3, what I need now is a new webcam ^^". And… ASSIGNMENTS!!! >.<" (need to hand one tomorrow!)

Oh yeah, need to jot this down:

**Plan To Get CD for This Month**

- Ayumi Hamasaki, Memorial Address (The one with the DVD)
- Ayumi Hamasaki, Duty
- SEB presents ayu-ro mix (in case I won the eBay bid, which is a high possibility)
