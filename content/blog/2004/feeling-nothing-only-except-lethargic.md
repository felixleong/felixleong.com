It's such a fine morning and all I feel is tired all over x\_x". Worse, during times of having assignment dues tomorrow, I just have to keep my eyes peeled. Duh… Looking at something better, at least I almost converted all my CDs. Uhh… but I accidently deleted my Memorial address files and my CD is back home ;\_\_\_;. Duh… And I just feel like listening that CD (well… since most of the songs really sings my emotions out loud)

In other news, my Euro de Key-a! is "In Shipping Process", according to CDJapan. I snigger at the English, but that doesn't matter anyway <333. Hope the package would arrive safely soon.

Hmm… OK, I just have to admit that it's just one of those uneventful days. Gotta face the radiation source for quite some time now.
