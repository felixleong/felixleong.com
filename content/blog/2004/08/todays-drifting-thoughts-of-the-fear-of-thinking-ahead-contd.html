This weekend has only shown how lethargic I can be sometimes, I&apos;m just feeling all tired and lazy for the whole Sunday. Of course, since this thread is a continuation of what I have stopped previously: Saturday turns out to be the gloomiest day I have ever experienced.

Dr Robert&apos;s words really had an impact on me… and I just can&apos;t stop worrying about Choon Hui, no matter how hard I tried. As much as I know that he wouldn&apos;t be affect by his words as much as I do, but I just can&apos;t stop thinking of how will he take Dr Robert&apos;s words.

The reason that I&apos;m worried is not that what he say is wrong, but what I&apos;m worried about is the contrary: As much what he says seem to be extremely radical to some, but it turns out to be extremely logical as well.

After many failed attempts to do anything to get my mind out of this worry, I finally picked up the courage to phone Choon Hui. To be frank I didn&apos;t dare to phone him during that time is that I don&apos;t want to appear too worried (or pushy… well, if it&apos;s a good description of it anyway). But yeah, speaking to him on the phone does blew my worries away. *glomps Choon Hui <=3, just gotta love this guy*

And now, reading back, there&apos;s really a lot of gaps in my own thoughts that really put me into pondering mode:
- What is my own dreams?
- How do I define a normal, boring life? (well… most probably I would say going on a boring 9-5 job with nothing to stimulate my interest, but what else)
- How do I define greatness? (Woa! That&apos;s a BIG question)
- Where am I now, as in the position in my own future road map?
- Who am I planning/going to be in the future (as in personal development and not identity)? (I&apos;m definitely not going to be a complete geek/nerd XD)
- Last but not least, why I believe all the things I done to achieve my dreams will be worthwhile in the end? (This pretty much popped up in my mind after I posted up the "In the end, does it really matter?" thought a few days ago)

On a very light note, my wound has healed and no more plasters on my arm :). But it takes a while before the new skin takes over.

The Olympics closes today, and I missed the closing ceremony (again) X(. First time I ever missed the Olympics ever since Barcelona. Never mind, I&apos;m definitely going to catch China&apos;s four years later ;).

Choon Hui won&apos;t be around today and tomorrow… and I really miss that guy. (Ah~ you know what I mean XD)

OK, that&apos;s about it. Going to the library now, ja &apos;ne~ ;)

[p/s: as a side note: I remembered that Princess Diana died on our National Independence Day tomorrow. Creepy :p]
