Shouldn&apos;t have procrastinated, the assignment came out to be rushed as well X(. Well… at least I manage to pull off an 18-page report within 7 hours. o.o" Anyway, the reports is about handling criticism without negativity, by the way. Kinda interesting when I ploughed through all the material I found.

Anyway, Steven have been acting odd today, it&apos;s not the usual, cheerful self. He kept questioning about friends and betrayal kinda stuff, but he didn&apos;t told me anything about it. Well… you know, those pessimistic views such as "Friends are only to be used" kinda stuff? (well… as much as I admit they do hold some truth) I suppose it has something to do with some sort of betrayal from his house mates or something, but I can&apos;t seem to get any information from him. Oh… well… -_-" I really hope that he could get over that soon, because I don&apos;t think I&apos;m able to handle his emotions in extremes.

Hmm… what else… Well… don&apos;t expect much stuff about Choon Hui lately since I really can&apos;t seem to get his attention, or having any friendly chit-chat lately ;______; (But I suppose this is good news to those who got fed up with my Choon Hui related post… whatever). Seems that he&apos;s really putting much more attention onto assignments… he&apos;s really the kind of person who put 100% of his attention to the work he dedicated to and loved.

Just feeling lonely when I miss people. Anyway, I think I better don&apos;t think too much… and I almost forgot that I have forgotten to take my shower. :p
