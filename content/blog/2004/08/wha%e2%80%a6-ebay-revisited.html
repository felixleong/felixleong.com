{% mark post -%}Check this out: http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=307&item=4028193366&rd=1

OK, it&apos;s basically the <b>same</b> item I bid, with the <b>same</b> description and stuff, and worse, it has the <b>SAME</b> seller! OK, now I&apos;m starting to freak out! For one thing, I NEVER receive any correspondence from the seller after I won the bid, and not to mention that (s)he would have at least mailed me about it.

And I have paid for it through PayPal @_@". OK… I think I better write something to that guy before I really freak myself out unneccessarily (and that person BETTER reply). Ugh… first eBay bidding have already gave me the creeps… I can only hope that it will be settled. *dies*{%- endmark %}
