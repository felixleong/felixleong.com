OK, I don&apos;t get my planned CDs. The DVD included version of Memorial address is understandable since by far I only knew one shop which stocks it previously. But I can&apos;t FIND Duty! I remember seeing that CD EVERYWHERE last time x_x". So… I suppose I might have to pick that CD up over Tower Records next month.

So, the CD I got for this month is kinda random, I got:
- globe: CRUISE RECORD 1995-2000 (Hmm… it seems that I have been picking up singles collections lately :p, but since I liked SEB presents EURO global, I&apos;m trying this one out)
- Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s RAINBOW (Basically I don&apos;t plan to get this since my sister had it, but the price tag of RM36.70 is pretty irresistible)

It&apos;s kinda shocking that EURO global and the original sounded SOOO different! But that&apos;s a refreshing change :).

Anyway, while I&apos;m at Time Square, I donated during a charity drive for a cancer NGO, and all of a sudden the staff handed me something that looks like a normal piece of cloth, and he said as a gesture of appreciation of my donation, they are giving me a short sewing lesson! (WHA…?)

So I was leaded over to a sewing machine by the staff (partly by force, because I&apos;m totally clueless at that time XDDD), so there&apos;s another female staff sitting there, saying that she&apos;ll be helping and teaching me how to use the sewing machine to sew a tissue pouch. So she took the fabric, make some folds out of it, and she taught me how to use the machine to sew the sides of the fabric.

So I gingerly put it under the needle… then I notice that I have NO idea on how to operate the machine. And my sewing REALLY sucked during my secondary school home improvement classes XDDD. But luckily that she&apos;s really helpful by helping me out. And so I gingerly operate the machine, making sure that I sew it in a straight line… and I did! And she compliments me I sew better than most girls :3. I feel sooo accomplished. Guess I can understand how those cosplayers feel when they finally finish doing their costumes :).

Anyway, I&apos;ll not use the tissue pouch since the flower motif looked extremely girlish, but I have it safely placed on my desk :). (I&apos;m thinking of taking pictures… but my webcam got spoilt. Duh!) Anyway… currently chatting with Allen about the crushes we had… and, umm, the fuzzy feelings :3. It does hurt a little when it came to me that I&apos;m not be able to with Choon Hui, but the positive thoughts took over eventually. :)
