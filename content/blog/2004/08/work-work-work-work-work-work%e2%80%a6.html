Been staying in the lab for hours @_@". Ugh… which is OK since at least I get a decent Internet connection here, it&apos;s kinda noisy though, but that&apos;s OK until my iPod ran out of juice.

Flashing back, yesterday have been a really bad day for me. Everything just doesn&apos;t work out… and as small those matters can be, the disappointment is so depressing that I really feel like a failure, and feeling like a total failure sucks. Just feeling all energy, motivation and passion being drained to a point that everything is not worth doing. I really feel like crying, it&apos;s really that depressing, but I just can&apos;t get my tears out no matter how hard I tried.

For some reasons, one of Coach Vee&apos;s comment just flashes into my mind <i>"Everything happens for a reason"</i>. That kept me pondering for some time… that&apos;s pretty much what happened before I had my early night sleep.

Then, about 12 hours later, and add another 7 hours, I&apos;m still here, working on those codes which is due tomorrow. Been in deep thoughts about human inequality, but that&apos;s for later. For now… work work work work work work work *in endless loop*….

[p/s: Thanks for the hugs, *hugs back ^^*. That really made my morning today]
