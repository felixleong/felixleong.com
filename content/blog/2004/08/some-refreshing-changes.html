Months later, this is how the tree looks like. This reminds me of a quote from my friend &apos;No matter how bad the situation is, as long as you don&apos;t give up, things will eventually sort itself out (and who knows whether it&apos;ll turn for the better)&apos;."</i>

Hmm… nothing much happened except that I kept forgetting things XD. And I can&apos;t believe that I left my Lolita&apos;s CD and a library book in the project lab yesterday! Thank god my stuff is still here when I came back to retrieve them. I&apos;m just relieved. ^^

There&apos;s still assignments dued, but I think I learnt my lesson, I&apos;ll try take things a little easier today… and make sure that I pay more concentration on the work on hand.

Exams are scheduled in two weeks time, just wish me luck.

And as a personal note, I&apos;m starting to notice how much my friends have helped me out during my ordeal, and I&apos;m really grateful to have them as friends.

So I&apos;m signing off from LJ, and I really need to more information for my assignments ^^".

[p/s: I&apos;m current experimenting with the "photo blog" concept, meaning that I might use my digicam to capture something for every major entries and put a caption right next to it. I don&apos;t know how would it turn out, but I suppose this is going to be fun ^^b]
