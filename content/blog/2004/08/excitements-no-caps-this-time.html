<hr />
Just a shortie:
- I saw squirrels in our backyard <3, they look so cute ^^. Too bad they do run pretty fast before I can flash my camera at them
- Stitches planned to be gone tonight if there&apos;s no surprises (Yeah for having that itchy sensation off from meâ€¦ or at least that&apos;s what I assume to be)
- Attending an artificial intelligence seminar later, it&apos;s going to fun (at least I know someone would be there, no prizes for guessing :p)
- NO ONE would be telling me to visit <a href="http://www.happytreefriends.com/">Happy Tree Friends</a> again @_@". One episode is enough to amuse and disturb me at the same time.

Signing off now :).
