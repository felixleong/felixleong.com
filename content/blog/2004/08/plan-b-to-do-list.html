Let&apos;s see…
- Get my USB stuff work on my aunt&apos;s compie so that I can connect my USB drive over there
- Set the network so that I can transfer the files over my compie
- Pray that all my software works >.> (especially the assignment critical ones)

My LJ is getting some attention from my coursemates, which really puts me in an odd situation. >.> I don&apos;t know whether it&apos;s a good thing. Anyway, it&apos;s just a place to dump my thoughts anyway. (which I can&apos;t do much since my brain is flooded with disaster plans)

Starting to sense some homophobes running around lately, which really made me wonder what wrong with me with my bisexuality anyway? But the news Steven told me today made me chuckle :p (I might consider putting some entries as friends-only… but I&apos;m still considering that, for now I just hold the info off for a while).

Anyway, Choon Hui didn&apos;t really show no signs of noticing what&apos;s happening around me (the LJ and what-nots), which does makes me a little bit worried on his reaction later… I just wish I knew what&apos;s ahead of me.

Still feeling freaked out now, I really can use with a hug ;___;.
