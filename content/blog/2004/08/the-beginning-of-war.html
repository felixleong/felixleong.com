My stitches will be removed in around 24 hours! ^^

No classes today since every single one of them have been cancelled, so more time for studies, I suppose? Well, currently I&apos;m still proscratinating in the lab checking my mails and stuff XD.

Warfare starts pretty soon, starting from the 4th September up to the 15th. It&apos;s going to be tough, but with enough preparation, I suppose I will survive :).

Probably this LJ will either have not much updates, or filled with exam related rants (like last semester), but we&apos;ll see how it goes. Just keep my fingers crossed for now.{%- endmark %}
