{% mark post -%}Hmm… just to keep things short:
- One of my aunt came to my university to apply for a position as library staff. Hmm, I wish her luck!
- My cousin, Chun Jin, just came back from India… and I NEVER knew he went there to study medicine o_O"
- Got myself J-Pop Meets Classics HARMONY Ayumi Hamasaki Melody, expecting another remix album from Ayumi Hamasaki, which I&apos;m correct except for one thing: There&apos;s no ayu vocal XDDD. It&apos;s a total classical arranged album. But then the music is beautifully arranged. Quite a nice CD to have ^^.

That should be about it.{%- endmark %}
