Darn! Got a deadline tomorrow and I can&apos;t believe that I procrastinated. >.<"

Anyway, pretty much by accident I found out my CD with my Memorial address music files <333. So I didn&apos;t lost them after all. So there I go, enjoying Memorial address on the bus. Then while "No way to say" and "forgiveness" is playing, some sort of unexplainable emotions just struck me that I feel like crying. I really don&apos;t know what kind of emotion that I&apos;m experiencing: it&apos;s not some sort of emotions which can be identified, like "disappointment, happiness, sorrow, touched"; it&apos;s a extremely complex and strong feeling, something which I really can&apos;t comprehend. If there&apos;s anything I knew… I really like Choon Hui… a lot, in fact. Yes, I&apos;m OK with living without him, I&apos;m OK that I can&apos;t be with him, but it&apos;s just that… his presence makes my life fuller.

But it&apos;s a good thing though. Well… at least that&apos;s what I perceive it to be.

Later on, things get slightly better, manage to have fun with friends, finally I got a respond from the seller of my bid. Got a extremely good feedback from him. At least I know that my CD should be in the postal service now. And now I do need to find more information for our Interpersonal Communication assignment, which is about responding to criticism. So… guess that should constitute on what I&apos;m going to do today :).
