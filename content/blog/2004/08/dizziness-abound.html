On the road shoulder right next to a traffic light, there&apos;s a potted plant placed there, and these little flowers always seems to catch my attention during a busy day. Perhaps it&apos;s because it&apos;s a small yet special patch of green among the greys? Or maybe they are just plain cute to look at :)."</i>

Yesterday wasn&apos;t much, just spent time changing dressing for my wound, typing away to get one pesky assignment off my shoulder, and as well as film some new choreographs ^^. I feel so like a slut when I choreo&apos;ed Lolita&apos;s Cherry Girl XD, but I really liked the end result. So yeah, I do need a decent compy to edit the videos ;___;.

Just notice that my CODS (Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome, for the uninitiated) for Choon Hui did somewhat fade away, which is a good thing… in one way of looking at it. I don&apos;t know, it seems that I have a feeling that… My happiness doesn&apos;t solely revolve/depends on him. Well, I still like him no matter what, but just that the feeling just seems to take another form? Or maybe I&apos;m not good enough to differentiate the complex feelings inside me? I&apos;m not extremely sure, but well, life is a journey of understanding one self, right? ;) (and so far I&apos;m enjoying the ride)

Today&apos;s a great yet normal day, apart from the constant itch from my wound, which is annoying but that signifies its healing. Everything went fine until late afternoon when I just have a nasty throbbing headache. >.<" And I do feel a bit sickly right now. Oh great…

Anyway, other small stuff includes me being the main designer in this coming Orientation committee, and I will be designing art stuff :)… And Choon Hui was my leader so-yeah-I&apos;m-happy XD. There&apos;s a presentation tomorrow to present my 20%-completed Java assignment, and that really sounds like a train wreck to me… just hope I can pull that through without having our group marks going rock-bottom.

Ah well… let&apos;s just see how things turn out tomorrow. My study plans/exam preparations starts today so no sudden surprises this time. And on an unrelated note… I have yet to grab Parapara NINE video off! >.<" (Downloading it now, BTW)

[:update note:]
I was thinking of catching up some LJ friends entry, but my head hurts so badly now that I can&apos;t reading more than a few paragraphs T-T. And without my laptop, I virtually can&apos;t manage the sheer amount of entries which I have left out.

So… I might not be commenting that much as I used to, but I just hope that you guys understand that I still care as long you are in my list. Take care, guys ^-^b.{%- endmark %}
