For some reasons my brain isn't working properly lately… well… here's a list:

- I NEVER KNEW THE PRESENTATION OF OUR DATABASE SYSTEM IS TODAY!!! Ahhhh~ Thank god my friend manage to fill in the gaps (as much as I find the designed system is… um, disappointing? Oh well… So far so good for a rushed system. But I personally feel bad about me and my obsessiveness for control and perfectness… Oh well.
- Seven subjects to catch up within one week… that's far from being fun. Yeah, I'm really nervous right now.
- Extending from yesterday's entry, I managed to catch up with Allen (Ganguro) on IM again. For some reasons, it feels like I'm experiencing an attraction… I don't know, it's been quite a while I have been having this kind of feeling, and having someone who has a lot in common in terms of thoughts and behaviour is really rare. Waking up today… I just feel odd all over, I can't seem to explain it, but my brains can't seem to focus on one point and kept debating with different issues surrounding that particular event.

    Life always likes to play a fool with us: it always seems that life always have to dish out everything that you are sceptical or something that you don't really believe. Frankly speaking, I always didn't believe in long distance relationship, experiencing fuzzy feelings online, sudden relationships (I preach a much more slower and steady "friends-to-lovers" kind of thing, if you get what I mean)… Yet suddenly almost everything just drops down into my plate and I experiencing that right now! I don't really know what I'm really feeling right now, it just looks too good to be true… I'm just… confused. Is it really love? It does seems to me like puppy love… Argh! I have been over rationalizing things again! >\_<"

Looks like I'm really having issues right now… (Stole the quote from Ahmed ^^") I do wish I had an explanation for my own feelings and struggle, yet I don't. I don't really feel like falling into the rush trap, but the bait is just luring… Oh my…

[:: edit, P/s: At this point, I have a nasty sense that some drama in my life is starting to unfold… For now, I just feel like slumping on a chair… Worst entry I have ever made, I would say]
