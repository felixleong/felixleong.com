*"I remembered once this tree has all its branches chopped off, and how sad I was to see it without its lush green leaves.*

*Months later, this is how the tree looks like. This reminds me of a quote from my friend 'No matter how bad the situation is, as long as you don't give up, things will eventually sort itself out (and who knows whether it'll turn for the better)'."*

Hmm… nothing much happened except that I kept forgetting things XD. And I can't believe that I left my Lolita's CD and a library book in the project lab yesterday! Thank god my stuff is still here when I came back to retrieve them. I'm just relieved. ^^

There's still assignments dued, but I think I learnt my lesson, I'll try take things a little easier today… and make sure that I pay more concentration on the work on hand.

Exams are scheduled in two weeks time, just wish me luck.

And as a personal note, I'm starting to notice how much my friends have helped me out during my ordeal, and I'm really grateful to have them as friends.

So I'm signing off from LJ, and I really need to more information for my assignments ^^".

[p/s: I'm current experimenting with the "photo blog" concept, meaning that I might use my digicam to capture something for every major entries and put a caption right next to it. I don't know how would it turn out, but I suppose this is going to be fun ^^b]
