## NOTHING'S GONNA TAKE MY LOVE FROM YOU / KAREN (from SEB18)

*(Also covered by Nuage and D&D [Retitled as In Your Eyes])*

Watching you this morning  
Everything is shining  
What a joy to have you  
By my side

Turn your head and tell me  
"I just need to hold you"  
Let me see your loving  
In your eyes

\* Eyes that give me passion now as they  
Call me thru the night  
Nite that till tomorrow shines in my heart  
Just to tell ya

\*\* Nothing's gonna take my love from you babe  
Anything that matter now is today  
I would never let you go believe it  
I wanna take and deceive (sic.) it

Nothing's gonna take my love from you now  
Nothing's gonna hide the moon of this nite  
I would never change my mind and leave you  
And nothing's gonna take my love from you

Easy like a rainbow  
Stormy like a tiger  
That's our love and always  
I'll be there

Make me feel another  
Treat me like a flower  
Get me to be stronger  
With your eyes

\* Repeat

\*\* Repeat
