title: Feeling Sick: Day 2

Today is another day, while people in Malaysia are having their pleasant holidays, I'm back in my room not feeling that well. Although my sore throat has healed today (which is a good thing), I'm now experiencing fatigue throughout the whole body. And now I have an aching back, a little drowsiness, and a minor running nose. Not to mention that there's a lot of phlegm stuck in my throat, so I'm constantly going to the bathroom to cough them out.

Interesting to note that while I'm finding the spelling of phlegm, the dictionary gave me the following definition:
**Noun: phlegm** *flem*


1. Apathy demonstrated by an absence of emotional reactions
2. Expectorated matter; saliva mixed with discharges from the respiratory passages; in ancient and medieval physiology it was believed to cause sluggishness
3. Inactivity; showing an unusual lack of energy

Hmm… that does describe my current situation well.

Not only that, for some reason, feeling sick and bad memories and emotions are really a bad match, yet they always come together as an annoying pair. Currently my brain is still flushing in memories of my previous crush and the time I have been together with him as room-mates. As how many times I tell myself it is really hard (near impossible) to make it work, the hurt yet doesn't want to heal yet. Perhaps I'm just deprived from warmth of caring love? Or is it that I'm feeling weak?

Tears came dropping down while I'm working with my school work (I have to drag myself to do it, cause the workload is just too much if I don't). Feeling hurt physically or emotionally is one thing, feeling hurt for both at once is another. I just don't know why I put up with it, I don't know why I'm reluctant to tell anyone about it? Am I trying to be strong? Or am I just acting to be one?

Guess I just pop in some relaxing and happy tunes to keep me a little bit occupied from any depressing thoughts for now…
