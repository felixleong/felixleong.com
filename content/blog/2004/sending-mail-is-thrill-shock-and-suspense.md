Phew! A day without fearing any close assignment dues and exams, what a perfect day to go to the post-office and send out some snail mail! :) After having unsent letters sitting on my table screaming to be sent, now's the time to send them out and let our recipients have some surprises later ;).

Apart of that, I remembered that I have to exchange some Japanese Yen to Dom so that she can help me to get some stuff during her Japan trip, so out I go and expecting that it's going to be quick. But as it turns out, it's more like an adventure: since most money changers don't have enough Japanese Yen to change, or they don't accept anything below 100,000 Yen (WHAT~??? That's gonna break my bank really soon!). I took me two hours to manage to change 6000 Yen (which is RM207/around US$55 T-T, boo hoo…), it seems that US dollars will be much easier to change over here… but I get a better ratio if I change it directly to Yen (i.e. = more money = more stuff to buy).

And wow! This is the first time I saw the actual 1000 Yen bill. The looks isn't too flattering since it's uses a lot of dull colours (compared to Malaysian Ringgit where the colours used are much more vibrant), but the paper used for the bill is pretty thick and it did looked durable.

(I intentionally resize it so that printing fake bills is really impossible)

And so, here's the thrilling part: send the cash via registered mail o\_O". I had one bad experience that I didn't concealed the cash nicely and ended up having the letter being ripped and the cash stolen (and I sent it via registered mail, which is much more secure!). So I did feel a little bit nervous when the thought of sending cash crosses my head, but well… if you want to get something rare, I guess I have no choice but to take the risk (darn! I do wish I had a credit card or at least have PayPal over here in Malaysia!) So basically I had spent the whole night create a camouflage with the art cards I bought, snug them nicely into it, and post it out.

For now… I better cross my fingers and hope that all my mail will reach safely to their respective destinations… REALLY soon.

McDonald's have revived the Blue Haven sundae and McFlurry over here (it's introduced here for the first time in conjunction with the release of Finding Nemo)! Woo, now's my chance to get my first bite of it ^\_^. And yum! Pineapple sherbet does taste good! (although I can't imagine why it's blue in the first place…)
