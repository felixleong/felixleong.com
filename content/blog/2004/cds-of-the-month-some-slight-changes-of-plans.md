OK, I don't get my planned CDs. The DVD included version of Memorial address is understandable since by far I only knew one shop which stocks it previously. But I can't FIND Duty! I remember seeing that CD EVERYWHERE last time x\_x". So… I suppose I might have to pick that CD up over Tower Records next month.

So, the CD I got for this month is kinda random, I got:

- globe: CRUISE RECORD 1995-2000 (Hmm… it seems that I have been picking up singles collections lately :p, but since I liked SEB presents EURO global, I'm trying this one out)
- Ayumi Hamasaki's RAINBOW (Basically I don't plan to get this since my sister had it, but the price tag of RM36.70 is pretty irresistible)

It's kinda shocking that EURO global and the original sounded SOOO different! But that's a refreshing change :).

Anyway, while I'm at Time Square, I donated during a charity drive for a cancer NGO, and all of a sudden the staff handed me something that looks like a normal piece of cloth, and he said as a gesture of appreciation of my donation, they are giving me a short sewing lesson! (WHA…?)

So I was leaded over to a sewing machine by the staff (partly by force, because I'm totally clueless at that time XDDD), so there's another female staff sitting there, saying that she'll be helping and teaching me how to use the sewing machine to sew a tissue pouch. So she took the fabric, make some folds out of it, and she taught me how to use the machine to sew the sides of the fabric.

So I gingerly put it under the needle… then I notice that I have NO idea on how to operate the machine. And my sewing REALLY sucked during my secondary school home improvement classes XDDD. But luckily that she's really helpful by helping me out. And so I gingerly operate the machine, making sure that I sew it in a straight line… and I did! And she compliments me I sew better than most girls :3. I feel sooo accomplished. Guess I can understand how those cosplayers feel when they finally finish doing their costumes :).

Anyway, I'll not use the tissue pouch since the flower motif looked extremely girlish, but I have it safely placed on my desk :). (I'm thinking of taking pictures… but my webcam got spoilt. Duh!) Anyway… currently chatting with Allen about the crushes we had… and, umm, the fuzzy feelings :3. It does hurt a little when it came to me that I'm not be able to with Choon Hui, but the positive thoughts took over eventually. :)
