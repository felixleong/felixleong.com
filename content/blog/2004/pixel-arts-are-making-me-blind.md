Gosh! I'm still working on artworks to be included in my portfolio… And doing everything in pixel level is killing my eyes. Anyway, here's some updated screen:

This is version 1.5 of the artwork… I like how I did the clouds, too bad I used too much colours.

This is version 2, with LOTS of shading (thanks for the critique by Sherman). I'm not totally impressed with the clouds… looks like version 2.5 should be around the corner.

Need to work on animated sprites soon before I might lose the chance for the job!
