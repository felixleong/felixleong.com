And yeah, now that you mentioned it, I seem to notice that I use "often more than not" a lot. XDDD (or, the one I'm more comfortable with: "more often than not") But I see that as a change in myself, because looking back, my catch phrase is "maybe". :p Guess I'm growing up somewhat :).

Coming back that "often more than not", the reason why I like to use it is perhaps it's part of my nature that I don't see things in black and white, I always leave that shade of gray there (as much people would say that I'm indecisive or not holding strong with my own principles). But my main viewpoint behind this is that: Most of the time, we are totally clueless in whatever we do, and yet we *thought (or acted)* that we *knew* what we are doing.

So, sometimes… it's a good thing actually feel the apprehension: the apprehension of change. Because that means that you're fully aware that you really don't know what you are doing. And by that, you'll start to appreciate change, it's a chance for you discover something new in yourself and in others. Whether you want to embrace it or not, that'll be your decision. But just… be aware and accept change when they comes. Locking them away would make you safe, but that also mean that nothing new will happen as well, and I believe NO ONE wants to live in a stale and boring life.

*"I guess the apprehension of change, preferring to go w/ the flow and forget what used to be and isn't anymore…but is it worth (it?)"*

As a final note… I wouldn't have word it that way if I were you. Because…. you can't forget what that is used to be… because… you're living with it. Who we are now are pretty much a collection of our own past experience and thoughts: And by that… it is what makes you… you, your own unique identity in existence. So every single thing is blended in you, you might overlook it but you'll never actually forget it. (Reminds me of what Yubaba's sister said in Spirited Away)

So… just go with the flow. But mind you, I didn't mean that you should go with the flow of others and the society in general… Follow the flow where your heart and soul tells you, because… deep down… you know what you want and where you'd want to go. Your answers are already in you :).

Don't care whether it is really worth it or not, because you can only know the exact answer once you have done that :p.

Oh yeah, finished listening with my CDs. Glad to say that they're both great :). Looking forward to buy hitomi's traveller CD next time :).

And yeah, by the way, my booklet cover design has been rejected by the meany Student Affairs Department heads (Refer to my earlier entrys, most probably Jan-March'ish, and you'll know how much they irked me) because they say that "it looks kiddy". Pfft! Where is their sense of cuteness? XDDDD Bleh, whatever. *does more designs*
