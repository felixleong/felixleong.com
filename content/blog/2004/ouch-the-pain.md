At this time of writing, I have been experiencing pain and agony. Okay, it's not really serious pain, but having sores and aches at several parts of the body isn't fun. So as the list goes, I got a slight headache, a sore back, and my wisdom tooth is killing me!

Apart of this temporary bodily pain, Chinese New Year is just around the corner :D! And I'll be going back home tomorrow and I finally get to see my parents, relatives and a bunch of old friends. Not to mention that I'm getting red packets (Basically, in Chinese New Year, our parents and married relatives (or perhaps even elders of friends) will give away red packets with money as a token of good luck. Of course, in exchange, we need to wish them prosperity before we get to receive them. :) ) However, it seems I don't get to keep them pretty long, because I might ask my foreign friend to get some CDs from Japan. And our currency is like… three times weaker than the Japanese Yen and the CD prices are still pretty steep if compared to the money I get. But I guess I need to make some sacrifices here and there T\_T. (Frankly speaking, it only seems that I can only save to around RM200 or so in a two-month period (around 6000 Yen or US$50)… And I expect almost half of it will be used for shipping costs… Boo hoo…)

Well… this Chinese New Year will be quite a busy one, since I'll be bring back forms for data collection (If you haven't been following this journal in the past, I'm working with my professor with his Chinese handwriting recognition system.) Nonetheless, I hope my Chinese New Year will be a pleasant one. :) (Somewhat I still have some doubts… but no harm wishing, right?)
