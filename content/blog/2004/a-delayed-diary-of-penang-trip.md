OK, first off, I haven't got over with the shock that I had experienced yesterday, and I have been staying at home the whole day trying to sleep it off. I guess I suppose that I'm OK enough to retype the fun incidence in Penang. OK! Here goes nothing! Let see whether the backdate entry function works :p… (Refer to the entries from 30 Apr - 2 May ^^)

Well… I'm pretty much OK now after listening to my newly bought CDs. I can really use some upbeatness now. Special thanks to my sweetie for being… sweet and attentive yesterday as well ^^. *hugs* In other news, I'm going back home tomorrow… I'm slightly worried since I'm bringing a big printer and notebook home, and yesterday's incident still haunts me a little. And not to mention that I have to go to Time Square tomorrow to pass the CDs to Hang so that I can buy a new handphone, .\_." And I do expect my family doing all those worried gestures… which I might not be completely comfortable with (well… it's not a bad thing anyway).

Well… just wish me luck.
