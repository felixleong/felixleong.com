Yay for me getting some more cash for the work I had done for my professor, now I had RM150 bucks to spare now :p.

Anyway, I'm trying to use it to get the other numbered PPP series which I don't have (namely 5 - 7), which means that I'll have a *whole* collection of VCDs =3 (If the customs let it through anyway :p). But before that, I definitely need to know how to deal with money orders and stuff. Anyone tried to make payment to YesAsia with money order or cheque? (umm… check in American English)

OK, if in any case I got my next salary soon, I'll be considering getting SEB150 and a couple of CDs over CDJapan, which is another experience.

Might get myself an iPod if I got my next loan instalment… but that'd be *months* away.

Gosh… I'm overspending before I had the cash XDDD.
