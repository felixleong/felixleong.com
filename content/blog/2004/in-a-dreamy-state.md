Sometimes I just wondered though: are dreams something that reflects a person's desires and feelings? Recently I have been having dreams of being loved, having close intimate relationships, having passionate hugs… Hmm… perhaps it does reflect my desires to a certain extent, but having them frequently does shows an alarming sign… Or maybe I'm just exaggerating things again?

Usually after having those dreams, I'd have woke up all refreshed and elated (Yay for a thesaurus, learned a new word today). This time… some sort of loneliness looms in me… I'm feeling so bad, I just refuse to wake up in hopes that either the dream continues or I'll sleep the loneliness off. So… Yeah, I miss all my lectures for today .\_.".

Well… luckily this is just the second semester. I just hope that this kind of habit doesn't continue, last semester is a total train wreck and I need to learn my lessons this time.
