title: Darn! Plan Foiled >_<"

I just hate it, having my plan foiled even before I got time to execute it. Apparently I have enough evidence to prove that he has a girlfriend >.<". And now I'm gulping down tons of water to avoid myself to cry in class (But then again, my eyes can't fool anybody).

Thinking back, I have to tell him someday, just not today after going through some initial (and expected) disappointments. Crap… why I always have the crush on "taken" people… I just hate it. ;\_\_\_;

Guess I have to revert back to probing mode… and I really need to go to the bathroom now to get my tears settled off with.
