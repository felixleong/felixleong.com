OK, my knee's better now. Although I didn't go to the doctor… Basically I thought I was late to meet up with my friend and my cell doesn't have enough credits to make a call, so I went back home (since my knee is getting better at that time). However, unknown to me, he's searching me all over the place while I'm away. :X If you are reading this, Vico, I'm terribly sorry for that. =.="

Anyway, my health has taken a downturn towards the bad and I now have some muscle pain, a sore throat, a slightly running nose, and a lack of energy. Looks like my recent assignment midnight rush has made an impact on my health. Thinking about it, not only my sleeping pattern changed during that period, I have also forget to do my routine health maintenance activities such as exercising and practising a healthy diet (not to mention I forgot to drink a lot of water, darn, should had heard my mother's advice).

So here I am… feeling sick (not seriously sick, just annoying), and I have a mid-term afterwards (gosh!). I can't seem to get my last-minute reading fixed into my head… hope I'll do okay (if not worse). After that, I better force myself to take some rest and at least do some exercise afterwards. Oh… Forgot about the water as well.

Oh, by the way, I just done some sketches for my Flash assignment, [click here to view it](http://mywebpage.netscape.com/Felix%20Leong%207/mt/).

I still struggling with animating with Flash, so if you had any tips, you had my undivided attention.
