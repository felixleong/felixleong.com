Darn! A lonely night like this does kinda make me feel obsessive-compulsive again. For those who didn't get the message: I've been missing Choon Hui only 6 hours not seeing him x\_x". But it seems lately he get pretty close with me, which does make me feel… well, loved. (I'm melting now)

But I suppose it's only a friendly gesture than anything else, well… but I would never know if I never asked. Ah… the dillema :p.

OK, must think of someway of keeping myself occupied.

[note: for the uninitiated, CODS = Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome. OK, I made that one up anyway.]
