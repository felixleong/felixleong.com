- OMG, OMG… One of assignments is due by Friday and I still have no idea what to code? ARRGH! Now my brains is full of threads now… (you better don't ask what thread means in computers :p)
- Stupid viruses is flooding my mailbox! Great… that's the last thing I wanted…
- Wow! According to a fellow PPStager in Singapore, they still have stock for SEB120 in Singapore. *excited* Hope he's able to get one copy for me. :) (PPStadium soundtrack is in there, yum! That's one of my favourite Para Para remixes! [although the video has a lot more yet to be desired])
- I'm currently multitasking to a point that I kept skipping classes… hope that doesn't continue
- Must… find… a… way… to… stay… awa… zzzzzzz~
