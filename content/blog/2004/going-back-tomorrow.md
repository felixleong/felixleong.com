Well… I'm going back to KL tomorrow to stay with my aunt. So today will be my last day with my family for this semester break. The heat is still unbearable and I got extremely exhausted the whole day (due to lack of sleep) and cranky (well… stupid weather). Other than that, it's just another peaceful day.

My parent make some chicken soup today, and I'll be having it a while later. But I'm sure that the taste will be the same as how I remembered it. Well, everything at home is always something to remember and full with nostalgia. When my mom mentioned that she's thinking of renovating the house… I just feel a gush of emotions coming up to me. Guess I'm going to miss how my house looks like if that happens, cause every item in the house almost have a story beneath their old looks.

For some reasons, I do feel a bit vulnerable, to a point that it really sounds crazy. Well, I just feel like one of the those single guys who is desperately wants to be married. Of course, the idea of marriage didn't cross my head, but the desire for some romance does expand to a point that I have been having really wild imagination, and that does amplify the vulnerable feeling I had in the past.

And yeah, I'm starting to miss my ex-crush again. Ah well. :p
