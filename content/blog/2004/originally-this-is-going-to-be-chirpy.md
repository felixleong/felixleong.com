Just came back from Penang, but as much as I was really expected to post a really exciting account on what happened during the past three days. But just when I'm on my way home, I was being robbed! It's no biggie actually, they only stole my cash (which is of a small amount) and my handphone. I should have trust my instincts and my knowledge that the route I'm taking is dark and quite deserted, yet I'm so in a hurry that I totally forget about my tiny inner voice.

Just after that, I'm in total panic that I forgot to lodge at least a police report and head straight back home (thanks [at least I can get home] or no thanks [for not doing what I should do: i.e. calling for help] to the fact that I still had my prepaid travel card). I'm safe now, but now I'm feeling really down.

I don't know… really. I've told my parents about it and they are glad that I'm unhurt and unscratched. …Guess I'll leave the exciting stuff when I got my spirits back up. Take care you all! (And don't try to walk in deserted areas without someone with ya!)
