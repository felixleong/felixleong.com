I got cornered by Choon Hui, again! .\_." This time with much more enthusiasm that I don't really know how to answer him. Basically he's really looked curious and inquire where's the *"girl"* is sitting in our lecture hall. Took me quite some *really* vague answers and embarrassed statements to get myself off from that. Well… basically I told him that if he knew, he'd be definitely be shocked. And I told him that when the time comes, I'll tell him who *"she"* was (who is just sitting next to me). And he said "It's OK, I really liked it to be a mystery." ^^"

But on the good side of things, before the "interrogation" occurs, I got into class and while I'm looking for him, he called me and invite me to sit next to him, which did made me extremely happy. Not to mention that we manage to chat quite a bit and that does made me understand him better.

I don't know, I really came to the point that I really wanted to tell him what I feel about him. It's just that I can't bring myself to it… well, for one thing, I can't really find one nice chance to tell him about it. Second thing is that, well, as much as we are colleagues in our research team last year, we only became friends last month. And having a sweet person like him, I don't want to risk a great friend like him, yet I knew that I really wanted him more as a partner than a really close friend (both alternatives are equally as good, just that having him as a partner is better). So it's like I'm being pull in both directions.

God I'm really confused now… well, not really. Pretty much I'm lucky to have crushes on really great friends, and I'm grateful for it. Till then, I'll still be keeping an eye on him while looking for a good chance to tell him about it.

As for day 3, I remembered that I have to start the car today. Well, I thought it was as easy as turning the key like what I did with my family car, but no, I was wrong. I keep trying and I can't seem to budge: the key just stuck there! And I KNEW that I got the right keys. So there I go, pulling the car keys in and out from the keyhole, and 30 minutes later, I only notice that it's written "Push… Accelerate" around the keyhole. And only then I knew that I was supposed to push down the gas pedal in order to turn the key!

Silly me! :p But then I learn something new today.
