It's seems that one sickness always comes with another, I got the running nose the whole day, which is… darn irritating (and I suppose it's annoying to others as well). Worse, I didn't bring enough tissue with me x\_x". Oh great… *snort* *sniff* ;\_;

What else… work piling up, deadlines approaching, moderating a few more boards (course related ones), and my CODS (Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome) is hitting me again (Yeah, I made this up, so shoot me XD)…

ARGH! Why these things always happen in cycles?! On the bright side of things, I'm enjoying the torture. Hmm…

I'm starting to have a love-hate relationship with my sexuality.
