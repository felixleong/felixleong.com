The weather is BLAZING/XTREMELY HOT (I DID dropped the 'E') today! Grr… I can't believe that this morning looks so cloudy and cold.

Anyway, got a Paypal account now, which I won't be using for the time being. Might be using it for eBay auctions in case that… umm, there's something that would catch my eye. (but then again, I'm running low on cash, need to budget a bit)

My best friend Steven has been telling me that I'm much more cheerful lately because of Choon Hui, which is a good thing, since I do hate feeling gloomy. Downside, I treat Choon Hui so well that my friends are a bit… well, not to say jealous, but just that they feel I treated them a little less.

Well… to all my friends (as much I don't think any of them reads them except those who knows me online): I love you guys and I really appreciate every single moment with you. And never once I have betray or intentionally hurt anyone of you and I always try my best to offer my best help whenever you need it. Just don't feel left out because of me treating Choon Hui a bit better, OK?

*huggies*
