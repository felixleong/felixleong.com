Just to keep things short, I'm feeling extremely bouncy during classes for a few things:

- That there's a big possibility that I saw Ryoko yesterday (OK, I have to admit that I still can't believe it…. yet I'm extremely excited)
- Having close contacts with Choon Hui (AH CRAP! I FORGOT TO GET HIS PHOTO FROM MY PROFESSOR! O\_O" Well… I'll get that tomorrow)
- The positive energy flowing inside me to conquer any odds… a feeling that I have been missing for quite some time
- Manage to have a nice conversation with Jacob (a great ex-college friend of mine) during the past few days
- Friends… they are getting more fun to get along with them ;)

It's a great day ^^. So great that the entry is shorter than what I had previously XDDD.
