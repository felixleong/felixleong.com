Phew! Finally I managed to get the photo from Dr Tay (our professor cum supervisor ^^), and here's the photo that I have promised you guys. (Thank you Ahmed for "pestering" me to get that one XDDD) Well… It WAS taken months ago… but I suppose it should do the trick anyway.

[:: NOTE: Just to be safe… for those who aren't cool with anything homosexual, give this one a skip ::]

For the uninitiated, I'm on the far left… but I definitely looked ugly on that pic XDDD (I need a hairstylist for cheap XD). And… The most important part, Choon Hui is on the far right. <333 =3 Well… he looked cuter (and his body more toned) now, but it's still him ^^. The ones in the middle is Yong Lin and Xian Yi, which are my colleagues (I wonder is this a good term?)

Yay! I finally had a photo of him. <333

[p/s: Hmm… we do looked like a bunch of geeks XDDD]
[Edit: Meep! The EVIL typo monster XDD (My *crushed* exposed… :p Heh heh, my bad]
