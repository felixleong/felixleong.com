Enough for my sadistic poems… I wrote this after I piece my fragmented thoughts towards what happened to a friend which I won't be naming here, but if you know that you're the one being mentioned (I know you knew), this piece is dedicated to you, specially. Sorry I had been a friend with the curse of fragmented thoughts (even the poem reads a little bit fragmented while I'm reading this), sorry I had been a didn't process feelings soon enough to give any comfort, sorry I had been so far away… (And I'm terribly sorry if I picked the wrong words for this poem -\_-", my vocabulary is so limited I just don't know what to write at times)

Other than that, this is also dedicated to all my friends who are reading my journal now, and I present you another (yup… ANOTHER) poem which I had written. Enjoy… and may everyone be blessed… and may unpleasantness be left behind…

Today you were crying…  
Every single bead of water from the shower  
Is beating so hard it hurts  
Yet the feeling is so warm…  
You hoped that your tears will be washed away  
But deep down… there's tears that cannot be washed away…

Today I'm crying…  
Every single pesky details which have no meaning  
Is bugging me so much it hurts  
Yet I'm feeling so blank…  
I hoped that my pesky problems will go away  
But deep down… there's tears that cannot be wiped away

While walking down the streets  
I feel so empty…  
Everything is walking past me  
But that doesn't matter  
My grumpy brain decides to flash these pesky matters  
And I thought my existence is for the sake of existence…

While walking down the streets  
Are you feeling empty?  
Everything is walking past you  
But that doesn't matter  
What are you thinking right now?  
What you thought of yourself now?

Today… I saw you  
And you only said "Hi"  
And nothing else  
I never asked "What's the matter"

My brains are so filled up with unimportant matters  
That blinds me from seeing anything except your poker face

Today… I bumped into something  
Which shows the other side of you…  
What are you feeling right now?  
What are you experiencing right now?  
Tears flowed down…  
I hate feeling blind every time

Is it too late…  
For me to extend my arms for you  
As much I know it won't reach you?  
We are so far apart  
Yet I wish that you can see me  
Wishing to tell you that we are together

Today I'm feeling down  
While I'm walking down the street  
I finally saw my existence  
While everything is walking past me  
I know it's far away from me  
Yet I wish that I'm able to grab you from here

Is it too late…  
For me to extend my arms for you  
As much I know it won't reach you?  
We are so far apart  
Yet I wish that you can sense me  
Wishing to tell you that I'm there for you

Friends can be gone and forgotten  
Just like everything that walked past you and me  
I wish I can be of any help  
To be around you while you're feeling down  
Even though we are so far apart  
But as long we are together… I promise…

Friends can be gone and forgotten  
Just like everything that walked past you and me  
I wish I can be of any help  
To be around you with my arms extended for you  
Even though we are so far apart  
But as long we are together… I'm there… for you
