May past hurts will be left behind without a trail, and hope that I'm able to move further towards my dreams…

### Empty Bed

When I open my door  
My eyes gleamed over you  
But you aren't really there  
Except for that empty bed

I let my burden down away from my shoulders  
I wanted to tell you how tough it was  
But you aren't really there  
Except for that empty bed

I trailed my fingers over the linen  
Slowly closing in to your soft hair  
But you aren't really there  
Except for that empty bed

Slowly I sit myself down  
Wishing for a lovely embrace  
But you aren't really there  
Except for that empty bed

Gently I lay my tired body down  
Wishing to see your angelic face before I sleep  
But you aren't really there  
Except for that empty bed… …

(I wish I'll never wake up  
 To be with you as long as I do  
 In the same empty bed  
 But you aren't really there… …)

Albeit a little bit sad, this poem is dedicated to an important friend I chatted today who gave me the spark of idea. Thank you for being my friend, and hope this'll continue as long as it can be maintained.

Continue to dream, my friends :).
