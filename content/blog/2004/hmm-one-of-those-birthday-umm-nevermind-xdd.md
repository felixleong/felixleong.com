Woke up late, miss work XDDD. So I'm at home now :p.

But actually I did that pretty much on purpose though, because I do need to revise for my mid-term test tommorrow. I just find another day slot of fill in the day off I took, just to be responsible :p.

Is thinking of going out today, but I suppose I have to do that AFTER my revision ;\_\_\_\_;. Bleh, I think I'll go later in the afternoon to buy myself a birthday present :p.
