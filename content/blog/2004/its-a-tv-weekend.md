Been at my aunt Ling's house during the weekends. Watching tons of movies while happily sinking our butts on the couch.

Since she had a DVD player there, I finally got the chance to watch my move REWIND PV DVD <3. The PV for Sugar Sugar Rain is just damn funny XD (well, the song is part of the reason). Then it's my PPP presents J-Euro Parapara DVD which is starting to dust (well… poor me for NOT having a DVD player :( ), and I started to like PPLove! More now (and I can officially say that my favourite would definately be Kaori ^^. Experienced paralist always never fail to impress).

Learn six songs within 3 hours, and now I'm trying to recall them back from memory before I forget them. Other than that… well… I'm tired. XD Class at 9 tommorrow, so I suppose I'll be totally busy. And there's going to be a good reason to hate Mondays now: It's all lectures :(.
