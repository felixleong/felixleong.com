I think I overworked my legs today for all the walking and dancing. Now I'm experiencing some serious leg cramps and muscle pain. Ouch!

Second thing of the day, during a chat session with my friends, they brought up the girlfriends issues and joke and someone remarked about gays and stuff. I can't believe that no one suspect that my bisexuality. Hmm… I wonder whether that's a good thing .\_.".

Class at 9 tomorrow, classes aplenty, but the good thing about it is having Choon Hui around. …Just hope that he didn't avoid me like plague if I ever got the courage to ask him… I can't even think of bringing myself to ask in an indirect manner. Gotta head for bed.
