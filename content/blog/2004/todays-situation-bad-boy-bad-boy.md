With all these test, assignments dues and society activities running concurrently during the past few weeks, I'm totally beat, totally deprived from almost anything good (except coffee, perhaps). Not to mention that the total lack of sleep that I had the day before does take a minor hit to my health, causing myself not feeling on tip-top condition.

I guess I have to blame my lack of time management, but I guess by stating that doesn't help a bit right now (not to mention that without me taking action to tackle it isn't going help, besides… now's the time for mending stuff… certainly not something that I can train or execute right away. So… this is my list of current pending stuff that shouts for attention today:

- My numerical analysis tutorial which needs to be handed up today (but obviously I can't hand up since the questions are pretty time consuming)
- Our Multimedia Technology tutorial need to be handed up this Friday
- Our society meeting regarding tomorrow's PC fair event (As much I had done my assigned task, we are understaffed for the time being)
- Our Multimedia Technology test tomorrow (spans eight chapters, but I understand most of the stuff)
- Decorating our society board (Basically the board is pretty much blank… only with our society logo and the small A3 sized poster for the fair. Doesn't looked too nice considering that the vendors can showing up tomorrow)
- A POSSIBLE surprise quiz for our Operating Systems subject which is rumoured since the other group is having it yesterday

My schedule looks something like this:

- 9-11am: Operating System Lecture (Possible quiz)
- 11-12pm: Discrete Mathematics Lecture
- 1-2pm: Numerical Analysis and Mathematics for Computer Graphics Lecture
- 2-3pm: Tutorial for Numerical Analysis and Mathematics for Computer Graphics
- 3-5pm: Urgent society meeting regarding the mini PC fair

Now, the important part,

## Situation Description:

Judging the fact that I need an hour to get to school, it's pretty much obvious that I had to make a really quick decision. It's either

- If go to school, I don't need to risk anything, will be able to help out with the society with the final preparations for the fair. But that also means that I might risk my health, become more stressed out because I can't finish my tutorial at all, and slack behind most of my stuff (Basically means that I have to sacrifice my health and school work… how much the toll is unmeasurable until the semester ends)
- If I don't go to school, I can have a good rest at home, able to catch up with my homework, and be more relaxed. However, I will have to risk missing the quiz and have a minor hit on my assignment marks on my Operating System subject. At the same time, I have to sacrifice the society by an unknown margin (i.e the lost which is incurred to me and the society is pretty much unknown, which can be from none to a major hit. Especially on the quiz part since I didn't do well in the mid-term test)

## My decision:

Play truant, forget about the whole meeting thingy, and stay at home and finish up my school work. With the reason that my health and my studies progress is more important. As much this option means risking the society and the test, the damage is considered short term since:

1. Our final test consist of 70 marks, so as much as the assignment will determine a possible A, the final test will determine whether you pass or flunk
2. The society has allocated people to do their own tasks, since I had finish my job (except for the board decoration) I can leave that aside, as much as it's a cold-hearted decision (considering that our society is understaffed at the time being)

Have your say.
