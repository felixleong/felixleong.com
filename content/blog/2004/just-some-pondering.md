First off, some unrelated stuff:

- Sent my cash to CDJapan today, just hope that the CD arrives within a month… or at least the cash being sent there safely
- Unexpected rains in Malaysia (umm… I guess it has to do with the monsoon season) really sucks
- The wireless Internet access at school doesn't work today. ARGH!
- Two mid-terms tomorrow… *dies*
- *stomps self for Choon Hui related stuff*

OK, been having some deep conversation with Steven today, and then I was pretty much left with some thoughts today. Well… I do have improve a lot in communicating and interacting with other people, just that it needs more polish. But what have made me ponder is that… well… I just have some feeling that I'm missing something from my puzzle. It seems that most of the time, my identity is pretty much built by what others have envisioned me to be. Don't get me wrong, I liked the person of whom I am now, just that… I just don't feel like myself, in one way. It seems that there's one gap in my own identity that I don't know of.

… I just don't know what it is… guess I might put my thoughts into drifting mode one day.

Anyway… in other news… OMG! Someone from my university saw my journal! *dies* I don't know whether I should put XDDD or ^\_^". Anyway… well… I'll just leave it as that.
