Oh yeah, just jinxed around with my compie stuff yesterday and I notice it's not my aunt's computer which is spoilt yesterday, but only the network card ^^". So now I had 3 computers running back at home (excluding the notebook, which I'll mention about it later), and I have NO idea how to arrange them in such a constrained desk space.

So now I had the (less) painful spoilt hardware list: A notebook, a laser printer, a network switch, a network card and a USB2.0 PCI card.

Luckily the USB and network card is still under warranty so I'll be doing just that later. Be checking out my notebook later, hope it'll be "discharged" today. It's been two months since his absence.

Be getting another USB card today since my webcam still can't talk with my new compie, and hopefully that'd work *crosses fingers*.

For now, I just hope that my computer woes will end soon (hopefully).
