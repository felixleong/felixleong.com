And I remembered that I <i>used</i> to hate PB2&apos;s TECHNO DRIVE last time. Then all of a sudden, I have picked up a certain liking towards the song. Hmm… I suppose there are some artist which does need some patience to like them? (*cough* Nuage *cough*)

Anyway, I have been strolling at my nearby CD store to check some CDs for my friend. Well… Somewhat I noticed that he started to become such a fanboy to some of the chinese artists these days, notably S.H.E and Jolin. Hmm… I did notice that I&apos;m no where from being better from him considering that I&apos;m <i>so</i> into J-Pop (Ayumi Hamasaki and MAX) and Eurobeat lately :p. At the same time, I started to notice PB2&apos;s (or Pool Bit Boys) debut album in the bargain bin. Well, I <i>know</i> it&apos;s there but I gave it a skip when I still hated TECHNO DRIVE. It&apos;s time to pick that up and give it a try, I said to myself. Besides, it&apos;s only RM9.90! (Less than US$3)

I&apos;m surprised that the CD have the kind of sunny kind of feel, pretty much every song in the album is really upbeat and happy. Hmmm… too bad there&apos;s a few rapping tracks which I didn&apos;t like that much (I cringe at some… well, what genre do you call hip-hop music?). A pretty decent album, I would say ^^, it can better if they had better tracks at the end and have more songs packed into it. Ah well, guess I&apos;m just picky :p.

In other news, I&apos;m thinking of using my laser printer to earn some extra income by helping others to print out documents, and it seems that my printer can&apos;t really rest with me printing lots of ebooks and stuff. Hmm… I wonder whether how much income I can get from there?
