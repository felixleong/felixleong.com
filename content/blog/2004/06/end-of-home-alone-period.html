My aunt came back yesterday night, which officially ended my home alone period. The wildest thing I ever done during this period: Filming videos outdoors XDDD. Darn I can&apos;t believe that I have become a good boy for a week (including waking up at 6 in the morning, which is almost an impossible feat for me)

Anyway, nothing much happened today, since I have *practically* being in my room typing codes for my assignments. Well, it&apos;s some good learning experience though ^^. But then again, I got tons of assignments lined upâ€¦ ._."

Dom said that her mom sent my package, wee~ Hope I get it within this week or so =3, then I&apos;ll be the proud owner of Euromach 3.

Now what I need now is obedience classes for my aunt&apos;s dog, he&apos;d NEVER stop barking at almost everything that moves! >.<"
