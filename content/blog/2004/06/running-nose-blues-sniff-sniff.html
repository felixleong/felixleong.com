It&apos;s seems that one sickness always comes with another, I got the running nose the whole day, which is… darn irritating (and I suppose it&apos;s annoying to others as well). Worse, I didn&apos;t bring enough tissue with me x_x". Oh great… *snort* *sniff* ;_;

What else… work piling up, deadlines approaching, moderating a few more boards (course related ones), and my CODS (Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome) is hitting me again (Yeah, I made this up, so shoot me XD)…

ARGH! Why these things always happen in cycles?! On the bright side of things, I&apos;m enjoying the torture. Hmm…

I&apos;m starting to have a love-hate relationship with my sexuality.
