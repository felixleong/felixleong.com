OK, I shouldn&apos;t have got this early, considering how many CDs I have bought recently. But then again, I wasn&apos;t planning to go out next week, so I suppose it doesn&apos;t hurt to get it earlier. (Yeah right) Anyway, I DO confess that I only got that for the TRY ME cover XD. Then and then, considering Namie Amuro&apos;s one of the bigger artist in Japan, I suppose that would serve as J-Pop exposure :p.

I was feeling sick in the morning T-T, like I was going to catch a cold or something. But I do need to attend classes, so I drag myself there. But then… I usually don&apos;t go to school at situations like this… Ah! Some of you might have guess the rest :p.

After that, I went to the developers meeting in KLCC, but I have to take a bus and walk there since that&apos;s the cheapest way. But at least after some hot sun and sweating I felt more healthier. So yay for healing the nature&apos;s way! But during the developer meeting, my absence does make me feel like some outcast, OK, not that serious, but I just don&apos;t feel like fitting in (well… you know). But then it does occur pretty often, so I&apos;m pretty much used to it. It did took me a few well selected jokes to get myself back on their tracks :p. Hmm… I guess I do need to sharpen my technical skills.

And… Oh yeah! Went to the CD stores today to compile a list of Ayumi&apos;s videos, CDs and singles that I dread to afford (which I don&apos;t) :p. But then since I can&apos;t have them all, I keep the list, post it up on our country&apos;s parapara forums and see whether I can get to make a business out of it. Hmm… I wonder whether that&apos;s profitable…

Got more work to do! ARGH! Ja ne ;)
