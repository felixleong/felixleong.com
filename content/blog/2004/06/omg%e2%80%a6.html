It just so happens that things just have to happen:
- It seems like my cell is giving me the problems… AGAIN! Augh! I hate keypads that doesn&apos;t respond >.<. If that&apos;s going to continue, I think I&apos;ll end up buying a new phone and live within a shoestring budget for months to come. AUGH!!! (Considering that I&apos;ve spent enough to buy myself a new colour phone or something. Dang for second hand stuff x_x")

- Shorter Story: Apparently my best friend noticed about my feelings toward Choon Hui. ._. Gosh! It&apos;s embarrassing!
Longer Story: Well, while my best friend, Steven, and I are having lunch in the canteen, we are getting online to check some stuff for our final year project. While we are searching for information, someone sent me a fun quiz about your personality barriers in love (It&apos;s in Chinese though). Here&apos;s a rough translation of the result I got:


<i>"You are sensitive with your feelings, and most importantly you have a strong desire to control, you tend to overdo in treating the person you liked. You will investigate the needs and likes of that person, and will do whatever to fulfil them without being told. You&apos;ll always try to know everything about the person thoroughly, and you treat them more carefully to a point that it even exceeds the care of their parents! This gives the person the choking feeling, and he will feel that there&apos;s another person trying to control their life, of course they&apos;ll try to run away from you! It&apos;s advisable that you need to control your desire to control, and treat feelings in a much normal and relaxed manner."</i>
[*Note: Come to think about it… it pretty much reflects myself accurately. Sorry for the lame translation though]

Just half way reading this:
Steven: That&apos;s does sounds like you.
Me: *gently nods, and then take a glass of water to drink*
Steven: *smirks & whispers* You like Choon Hui, isn&apos;t it?
Me: o_O"

Gosh! I almost sprayed water on my notebook by that comment! *flushes red* Oh GOD! Is my actions THAT obvious?!! o_O" *hides away in shame*

[:: Random Stuff ::]
- On a side note, I managed to sit side-by-side with Choon Hui just now <3. Umm… I suppose that how Steven affirms his suspisions.
- I didn&apos;t notice until akirakongouji mentioned it: I didn&apos;t get many comments in my journal XD. I wonder why? :p (Too much to read for some random babbling, I suppose?)

But then, please comment when you feel like saying something ^^. I definitely want to know about it and that would certainly help to get to know my LJ friends better *^^*. (Well… since timezone differences does make it harder to have chat sessions :/)
