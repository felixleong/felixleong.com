{% mark post -%}Gosh! Talk about last minute work.

OK, back to the topic, well, presentations in big classes who are keen in listening to it is really freaky, I get all nervous for all that attention I get. But at least my presentation skills getting better and I didn&apos;t stammer as much as I used to. Guess that&apos;s an improvement.

And, notes to self: Don&apos;t prepare your cards one hour before you want to have the presentation.

Having Choon Hui around always made my day. Gosh I wish I can make the time stay still (I hate to think that I have to graduate and seeing both of us go separate ways ;_;){%- endmark %}
