Ah, what a good day for boring rants:

- I missed getting stuck in school, well… the rain&apos;s kinda heavy just now. And I only noticed that I forgot to close the windows back at home… which is OK until I notice that I forgot to put my recently cleaned-clothes, which is now next to the windows, back into the closet! Oh great! Hope they aren&apos;t wet when I got home.

- I haven&apos;t got myself an assignment group for my Software Engineering subject >_<". I knew there&apos;s one group which has an opening but I didn&apos;t feel like joining them, considering that I have been in the same group with him and I hate ending up doing all the work by myself. Darn I hate that!

- All my IMs, and even AIMExpress didn&apos;t work today! Worse, my Friendster account suddenly goes "Ka-Poof!" all of a sudden. I suspect that there&apos;s a server problem going on there. Anyway, I hate retyping my profiles.

- I noticed that overcharging my cellphone would cause some interruptions to the keypad. I guess my charger can kill my cellphone X(. Gotta be careful, I suppose. (Darn! I should have spend more on a original charger!)

Ah well… Anyway, need to get another new number for my cell, since my current operator gives me bad coverage (I suppose it has to do with my phone, but I HATE changing it considering that I just got it). Till then, I&apos;m just need to drag myself and read a lot more now.
