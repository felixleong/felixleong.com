{% mark post -%}Just to keep things short, I&apos;m feeling extremely bouncy during classes for a few things:

- That there&apos;s a big possibility that I saw Ryoko yesterday (OK, I have to admit that I still can&apos;t believe it…. yet I&apos;m extremely excited)
- Having close contacts with Choon Hui (AH CRAP! I FORGOT TO GET HIS PHOTO FROM MY PROFESSOR! O_O" Well… I&apos;ll get that tomorrow)
- The positive energy flowing inside me to conquer any odds… a feeling that I have been missing for quite some time
- Manage to have a nice conversation with Jacob (a great ex-college friend of mine) during the past few days
- Friends… they are getting more fun to get along with them ;)

It&apos;s a great day ^^. So great that the entry is shorter than what I had previously XDDD.{%- endmark %}
