{% mark post -%}Just clearing out my bookshelf just now so that I can fit my books in. Shoved away all my previous lecture notes somewhere, and stack them nicely so that I can dump them to my juniors, rearrange some of the books and now my room is much more tidier… mum, at least the bookshelf XDD.

Then I only noticed that my books have almost taken the whole shelf already @_@". Gosh… how much books I have bought lately… And I have a lot of books lent to my friends! Gosh I need another bookshelf.

On an unrelated note, filmed a few more videos today <333. I have been forming ideas for Go Go&apos;s And The Monkeys, I have finished with the choreograph, but I&apos;m not too satisfied with it that I&apos;m still tweaking some minor details.

Phew! Got more work to do now ^^. Oh yeah, I need to get more protective sheets for my books.{%- endmark %}
