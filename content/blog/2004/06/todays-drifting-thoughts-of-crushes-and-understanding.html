First of all, here&apos;s another poster I did for our society:

[p/s: As few words as it seems, it might need some grammatical fix if there&apos;s some hiccup. Do comment if you notice one ^^]

Anyway, school work is starting to pick up, which means that I definitely have to make myself working or else I&apos;ll fall into the procrastination trap again. And this summer seems to be quite special, I mean, seeing that people are into the lovey-dovey mood lately (including yours truly). Class has never been the same to me again, since I have been constantly fixing my eyes towards Choon Hui… although I did try to tone down my gestures when we are close together and I pretty much "acted" like friends. He caught my eyes once though, which did made me quite nervous :p. Oh gosh, now I&apos;m pretty much mixed up on deciding whether I should take my move or keep on observing XD.

But on different point of view, I did notice that I get nervous when I&apos;m far from the crushes, but after getting within the close distance, I just feel the sense of calm inside me. Hmm… weird? Or am I suppose to have heartbeats as fast as it&apos;ll cause a heart attack any time and flash a face with the likes of a tomato instead? Hmm… Guess I do need some time to understand my responses towards things, but then that does make me feel like I didn&apos;t understand myself well.

More often than not, I notice that the conversations I had with Ahmed is starting to hit on me. Well, I said that in a positive way, but sometimes it seems that … well, I had all the assets, philosophy and understanding to run my own happy life, but more often than not I don&apos;t feel confident enough to take control of my own life (if that makes any sense, anyway). It seems like I&apos;m always taking the path of less resistance and being too sensitive about how other people feel, which always ends up having myself sacrifices a lot of things.

Picking my own lines which I left behind in Ahmed&apos;s journal:
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>"I don&apos;t really how to put this without me shuffling through my fragmented thoughts, but sometimes we just can&apos;t see ourselves from another person&apos;s perspective without having someone or something to help us out. Picking a line from Fruit Basket (recommend the manga/anime ^^):

"We are like dumplings with a sour plum at our backs. And more often than not, we always admire the sour plums on other&apos;s back, yet we can only see rice on ourselves." (I pretty much recall this from memory and literally translate it. But I suppose it should do the trick)

So sometimes… well, I suppose we can&apos;t help but feeling a bit… inferior. I suppose that&apos;s what friends are for sometimes. OK, that might sound a bit weak, but who says that strong people doesn&apos;t need reassurance in the first place. ;)"</i></div>
Hmm… Reassurance. I don&apos;t know, sometimes it&apos;s just hard to expect reassurance from someone without sounding like a drama queen/king or anything, but then I didn&apos;t know a good way to call for help either.

Ah crap… deep thinking always jumble up and fragment all my conceived thoughts.
