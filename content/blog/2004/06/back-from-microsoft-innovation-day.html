Phew! What a day! Anyway, just came back from the event. Putrajaya is definitely an experience to me.

Anyway, I woke up today and I only notice that the roadblock that head to school still remains (heard that there&apos;s an accident where a lorry crashed into a pedestrians overhead crossing). And so I thought that I&apos;ll be late to catch the bus arranged by our university, but apparently I&apos;m just lucky that they didn&apos;t depart yet.

Anyway, traffic jams aside, Putrajaya is really cool <3. I don&apos;t know, I just like the surroundings, a combination of architectural splendour and well kept greenery <333. I just wish that I&apos;ll be able to stay there (or anywhere like that).

Manage to see Bill Gates in person, as much I was pretty far away in the hall. I… don&apos;t know, I just didn&apos;t feel excited to see him like I might have expect myself to be in the past. Hmm… Anyway, the security talks are really interesting.

Now I&apos;m back at home, tired. Well… guess that&apos;s all. I&apos;m starting to feel my obsessive-compulsiveness rushing back on me… gotta… control…
