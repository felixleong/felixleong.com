Wee~ Another two-in-one entry. OK, I&apos;m just plain lazy to a point that I find no reason to connect myself to the Internet just to update my journal. So here it is:

<u>Time: 2pm</u>
<i>どきどき[doki doki]	(adv,n,vs) throb, beat (fast), (P)</i>

Meh… Now I definitely have to admit that I feel (and perhaps being) like I&apos;m in some sort of clichéd Shoujou mangas. Well, it happens every crushing moment I had, and it does get more and more intense by the day. While typing this, MAX&apos;s Person I Need is being played in the background to suit the mood. Ah~ Fleeting desires… And I&apos;m starting to miss school now. And guess I have another favourite J-Pop tune now.

Anyway, some unrelated events, washing a week&apos;s load of laundry is not really fun, and seeing that clouds are starting to build up at a sunny day like this, I really hope that the clothes dries up before it had the chance to rain. I&apos;m thinking of going out to the mall today to check for DDR dance mats for Allen afterwards if the clothes dry soon. Hmm….Guess I&apos;ll be at my room now to savour the feeling I had now while waiting.

Ja &apos;ne!


<u>Time: 11pm</u>
Finally I decided to go outdoors today, it&apos;s quite a bad idea to contain my energy and have a heart attack back in my room :p (Hmm… does this make sense). Anyway, the outcome: No DDR dancing mats T-T (at least PC compatible ones). I wonder whether DDR has went out of style in Malaysia… hmm… I guess I might as well give mine to Allen, since I&apos;m not really into DDR lately and my dancing mat is collecting dust.

Drool over Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s music clips in the CD store today, since Ayumi Hamasaki Complete Clip Box is the featured item. Woo~ That&apos;s tempting, thank god the condition of my wallet definitely spare me from overspending.

Being at Time Square, it&apos;s kinda funny seeing Tommy in a Vietnamese like uniform, as he is working as a waiter in a nifty restaurant called Little Hanoi. At the arcades, the ParaPara Paradise machine is being uneventful, well… considering that two of the most active members (read: me and Tommy) is busy with our stuff. But I still have fun with a few games. I managed to catch Clon today and he&apos;s glad to give me some Pump It Up! lessons ^^. Well, my games doesn&apos;t go that smoothly, consider the fact that I&apos;m still trying to get used to the arrow scheme and the metal. It&apos;s not as fun as DDR, but that does detract me from getting bored with the PPP machine. Hopefully I can learn hip-hop along the way, which does complement my dance experience. (first being parapara, of course XD)

After that, I went to Low Yat (note: it&apos;s a shopping complex known for selling computer stuff, for cheap as well) to hunt down the dance mats (which, as said before, I failed XD). And I&apos;m pretty surprised that bumped into Soon Keat today. He&apos;s my college friend as well as ex-house mates during my college years, and now he&apos;s studying in the same university with me, so I suppose I can say that he&apos;s my junior XDD. Anyway, he came with his twin brother and two Indian friends. They are shopping for some computer stuff, while Soon Keat is trying to survey prices for notebook computers. Accompanied them and chatted with them, that&apos;s was pretty fun. Aiming for a budget speaker which sounded decent, and got myself an optical mouse for my notebook, considering the cheap mechanical mouse I had is more of a hassle nowadays.

Back home, well… the mouse does work nicely… under the condition that the surface underneath is smooth. Bleh, but I&apos;m still happy with it (as long I had a piece of paper underneath it). And at least I did have fun and I can keep myself sane from the flooding thoughts of Choon Hui XD. Oh gosh, I&apos;m dwelling too deep into this! XDDD Ah… crushes.

Anyway, tomorrow&apos;s uncle Vincent&apos;s (Aunt Ling&apos;s husband) birthday, I wonder whether Aunt Ling have any plans to celebrate it. And secondly… whether I&apos;m invited or not XDDD. Aunt Ling has mentioned that she had plans to watch Harry Potter, for one thing. OMG~ Squee~

Well… Let&apos;s see what&apos;s going to be in stores tomorrow then. I can&apos;t wait ^^. (Well, if I don&apos;t get the fun, at least I have work to keep me company :p)
