{% mark post -%}Oh~ June! Time does fly, I guess, now I just feel like I have already wasted half a year doing pretty much nothing than having nasty exam results XD. This also signal quite a number of things: after another month, it&apos;ll be half year after I started the journal, having participated in PPStage for half year, know a lot of great friends for half year (Ahmed and Phil comes to mind ^^)… have NOT been actively participating in RPGamer for half year >_>…. Well… reading some of my past entries does brings back memories.

Anyway, the timetable is being messed up again, but the changes aren&apos;t that drastic, but having one lecture at 8 in the morning. Augh! That&apos;s not fun (Thank god it&apos;s only one).

Other than that, no snail mail yet for me… ;_;. I&apos;m pretty sure that Nine&apos;s package is stuck some post office somewhere, and my CDs from Dom should be floating around somewhere…. but no, there still no sign of them. I just hope they don&apos;t get stucked in the customs >.>.

After two days of heavy rain, it&apos;s getting hot again. Bah! I&apos;m now in a nasty mood X(.

[:: UPDATE ::]
Just got a mail from Sherman… and I didn&apos;t get the pixel artist job ;_;. Ah well, it&apos;s better that way &apos;cause my timetable sucks anyway :p.{%- endmark %}
