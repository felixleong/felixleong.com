{% mark post -%}Maybe it&apos;s just me, but I think I&apos;m bound to hate Tuesdays in odd weeks because there&apos;s only one hour of lecture during that day in odd weeks (we have two tutorials in even weeks). Judging from how much time I have to spend just to get to school, it&apos;s just so not-worth it! (as much looking at the bright side of things that can be my honeymoon day of the week)

Worse, that also means that I&apos;ll not be able to see Choon Hui for long ;_;. That cruel because now I&apos;m starting to miss him. (but then again, I should miss him more during the weekends instead XDD)

I just went to a warehouse sale held by WordWare (it&apos;s a distributed for MS Press in Malaysia… Yup, it&apos;s books all right!), but then I didn&apos;t know where their office is, not to mention that I really want to go there by bus (judging that I have no transportation what so ever). So I just check StreetDirectory.com for the map, and notice that one of the bus will get through there for sure, and I went out for some adventure alone ^^.

I can&apos;t believe that everything went on so smoothly that I reached there effortlessly ^^ (as much as I went there only for the first time and I&apos;m really bad with directions). The staff there are really friendly, and I got myself some expensive books for cheap ^^b.

Can&apos;t wait to tell my friends about it.

As for now… well… I really miss Choon Hui here ;___;.

(and gosh I wonder what will happen to me if:
- I really manage to have him as my boyfriend
- he avoids me like plague when he knew about this){%- endmark %}
