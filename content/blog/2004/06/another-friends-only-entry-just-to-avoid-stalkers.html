<b>Short Story:</b>
I&apos;M GOING TO HAVE THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR A WHOLE WEEK!!! MWAHAHAHA~

<b>Longer Story:</b>
My aunt will be leaving to Sarawak to attend a week long camp or some sort, and I&apos;ll be taking care of the house starting from this Saturday.
<i>Plus Point:</i>

1. I get to do whatever things that I might get nagged, especially having the TV on during midnight with high volume (since the living room is near her room)
2. Can film more routines at home
3. Can try something daring… hmm… like running naked in the house??? XDDD

<i>Minus Point:</i>
1. I have to come home early everyday T-T (around 6, just to switch on the lights and stuff)
2. Housework!!!

As much it definitely good for partying and stuff, but since I&apos;m not really a party animal, so usually I&apos;ll be staying at home being alone for a week (which is OK to some extent). Now if Choon Hui is going to share my bed that&apos;d be perfect, myeh heh heh… *evil grins* (Snap out of your dream, Felix!!!)
