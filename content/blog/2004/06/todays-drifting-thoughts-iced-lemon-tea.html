Two years ago, I got addicted to iced lemon tea, and for some reasons I told my friends that it tasted like love, yet I pretty much didn&apos;t understand why I said that.

Now after having my own experience, joy and sorrow of love (well… one sided, anyway), I think I&apos;m starting to understand the sour yet bitter-sweet sensation.

Well… just a thought after something happening, guess I might get another packet of instant iced lemon tea when I go to the hypermart.
