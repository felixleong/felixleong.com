Basically we did the same presentation like we did on Friday, only that this time I&apos;m doing it in my class. My presentation is great, at least I&apos;m much more confident this time since I&apos;m much more prepared ^^. And I get positive response with my "pen throwing" stint. Well, I&apos;m trying to emphasizing the point that we can&apos;t separate ourselves with pen and paper in the digital age, so my line is like "However, we can&apos;t just throw our pen *throws the pen away, hearing that it hit the ceilingâ€¦ hard* and change the way we use to store information".

I&apos;m just happy that people are enjoying it ^^.

I&apos;m going to Putrajaya to attend Microsoft Innovation Day tomorrow. Heard that Bill Gates is coming, so cool! <333 Downside: Choon Hui&apos;s not coming. But I&apos;m sure that I&apos;ll be able to enjoy myself there ^^.
