OK, there&apos;s a big possibility that I REALLY saw Ryoko ;_;.

<a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/RYOKO-ODAKURA/">According to her official website</a>, she did mention her JGTC schedule… and there&apos;s one line on the front page saying: Ｃｌｕｂ　Ｆ撮影会お疲れ様でした。今週末はＧＴ選手権ｉｎセパンが行われます。 >> Babelfish Translation: It seemed the Club F photographing meeting tired way. This week end GT championship in Sepang is done.

NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! *stabs self endlessly* ;_______;
