HUH?!!!!

OK, I just watched Living with The Future on TechTV just now and they are running a documentary about human genes. I got confused in some parts, but here&apos;s some interesting trivia which I remembered:
- In our DNA, only about 1.5% of the proteins are actually genes
- Our gene count is twice of the gene count of a fruit fly (HUH??!!)
- Our human genes is about 99% similar to each other (i.e. You and I are almost identical in the gene level), and 50% of our genes are similar to a banana!
- Sperms mutates more than an egg, which also means that 2/3 of our human mutation is caused by the males
- More than half of our genes is ours! (I wonder who genes were those o_O")
- 2/3 of the genes which give us the sense of smell is already blocked (meaning: we are MUCH more less sensitive to smell than we are used to billions of years ago!)

Hmmâ€¦ That&apos;s something.
