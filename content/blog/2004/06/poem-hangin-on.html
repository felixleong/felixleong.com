{% mark post -%}It&apos;s a dark and rainy morning today, well… not a good sign when you have to walk to school. Anyway, creativity just struck and I drafted this one. This might not of any real poetic value (well… I personally didn&apos;t like it that much), but I suppose I just post up to share:

<b><u>Hangin&apos; On</u></b>

"Hang on there!"  
I hear your whispers around me  
Slowly I opened my weary eyes  
Seeing nothing but my own illusions…

I have been clinging on this cliff… helpless  
So long that my past is fading away from me  
I have been trying to recall  
those fading memories when I was small  
The time when I believed in dreams…

"Hang on there"  
I hear your whispers around me again  
I knew it wasn&apos;t real  
Yet I&apos;m still looking around  
But what I see is only dark skies  
and there&apos;s no clouds that looked like you

"Hang on there…"  
 … your whispers are getting softer  
"… hang on there…"  
 … I&apos;m starting to notice  
 that I&apos;m hanging on to this hopeless cliff for too long…

"<span style="font-size: 60%">… hang on there…</span>"  
 … I&apos;m starting to remember the past…  
 … Up till we went separate ways…

"…"  
"NO! HANG ON THERE!"  
The cries filled the gloomy skies  
I just don&apos;t want to lose your voice!  
… Arms trembling  
… I&apos;m starting to lose my grip…  
Please… Let me continue with my journey…  
I don&apos;t want to miss you one last time…

…  
…  
"… <span style="font-size: 60%">Hang on there</span>…"{%- endmark %}
