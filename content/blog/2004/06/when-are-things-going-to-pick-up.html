Hmm… the past two weeks has been… uneventful. It might be a good thing, but certainly not when you are having 6 subjects on the line. It seems too quiet. I hate that because that also means that assignment due dates will sneak up on you and pounce you while you are not keeping your guard. Maybe I&apos;m just worrying myself, but I got bitten by that once and I swear that I don&apos;t that to happen to me again! >.<"

Anyway, found an assignment group for my Software Engineering, which I perceive to be a better set of members that I can get. Hopefully that my gut feelings are true, because the last thing I wanted is:
1. lousy assignment marks,
2. lousy members (I hate pointless squabbles),
3. Recovering from a disaster (which is usually bound to happen… But then it&apos;s a software engineering course where you are suppose to learn how to avoid from one!),
4. All of the above.

Well… on the bright side of things, my friends are all in a cheery mood now, which does lighten me up a little. But then I think I&apos;m missing something… I suppose I&apos;m missing the plain old fun with friends which I had during secondary school (or high school in the American education system). Fun has been seeping out from me, well, that how I feel now.

Well, I wonder how Allen&apos;s coping with his layout stuff (I sent him my LJ override codes ^^). I guess I might spend some time working one for him if he&apos;s stuck *^^*.

Anyway, for some random thoughts: *cough* extremely feminine gay males :p… Well… what worse is perhaps them faking the feminine out. Augh! That&apos;s going to be nasty! (remind me of cheesy, clichéd Hong Kong romantic movies) XD
