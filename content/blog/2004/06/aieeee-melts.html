{% mark post -%}If there&apos;s a happy, happy day this year, this have to be it.

Anyway, our Interpersonal Communication lecturer ROCKS! My lectures and tutorials are so packed with fun that I just can&apos;t stop laughing my head off. Not to mention Ms Nicole (lecturer) and Ms Alugu (tutor) have a really good sense of humour while recounting their stories and joke around when they tried to introduce a new concept! <3

Now I do have something serious to look forward to at school. ^^ (and I guess this will be the time when I really would do my homework voluntarily)

Then the next thing of course is definitely Choon Hui. Well, he didn&apos;t show up in the morning, which made me a little bit disappointed. But the Interpersonal Communication class made up for it. Later at noon, I&apos;m quite pleased that he show up during my Cryptography classes (one of the boring Math classes, and I definitely need him to stay awake XD). What sweeter is that my friends managed to get places two rows back from him, so I have a really close view of him. *SQUEE~!* And as if that&apos;s not enough, throw in another crush (Bean, which is my first crush whom I have gave up hope) sitting on my back and that makes the picture so complete that… well…. I don&apos;t know where to look XDDD.

Later after class, I finally found a great chance to get close to Choon Hui and talk to him. And all of a sudden he just asked whether I would like to donate for a good cause, and I&apos;m like "huh?". Then he showed me today&apos;s paper which shows a poor family of six or something with their seriously ill father having diabetes. OK, I confessed that I didn&apos;t read the whole thing and I admit that he got my soft spot (him and donating for a good cause, I guess he didn&apos;t notice the former though). But it&apos;s just a kind of genuine gesture of him that I didn&apos;t get suspicious nor hesitate to stuff him 10 bucks without any rational thoughts. And yeah for my stupidity because he&apos;s my current crush.

Gosh! I can&apos;t resist someone with a heart of gold and I&apos;m now melting. Gosh! He better don&apos;t score higher in my books or I&apos;ll get crushed harder if:
- I ever fail to have him, or
- his perfect image is being smashed due to one wrong doing of his in the future.

Oh gosh… I&apos;m just wishing that I can keep Choon Hui for myself now… ._."

Oh! by the way, stolen this from maryssa:

Oh gosh I never knew diseases can be deadly in a cute way.

[::UPDATE::]
Oh gosh I REALLY liked the flu, bookworm and the common cold ^^. And it&apos;s not that expensive either! (Hey! US$6 = RM21.80 is really a deal ^^) … But the shipping is like… US$15.34?!

Oh crap… T-T{%- endmark %}
