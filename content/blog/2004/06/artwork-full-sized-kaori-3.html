During classes this afternoon, I just got bored in class, so I just simply pulled out one piece of lined paper and tried to doodle on it. However, to my surprise, one of my initial sketches looks so good that I delve into drawing itâ€¦ and ending up with my satisfied with the art and regretting that I didn&apos;t use a blank sheet at the same time XDD.

Anyway, enough crap, <img src=http://img32.photobucket.com/albums/v95/seh_hui/artwork/kaori.png>

For those who had noticed, it&apos;s Kaori in my Flash assignment ^^v. It&apos;s pencil sketched and GIMP was used to adjust the levels and contrasts. Enjoy!
