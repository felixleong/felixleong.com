MUAHAHAHAA~ I have the same surname with Richie and the same first name with the main character of Initial D XDDDD. (Talk about some random stuff which I&apos;m happy about XDDD)

But then I think I better stick to my own Japanese-pronounced Chinese name: 龍 Ryuu (Dragon) 仕輝 Shiki (Umm… Radiance servant??? XDDD){%- endmark %}
