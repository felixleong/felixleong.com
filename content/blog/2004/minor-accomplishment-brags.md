Phew, finally I get home after getting some groceries. Well… I always tend to avoid any heavy shopping, to be frank, but for today, I just have to because I do need to restock some of my daily necessities. Just just soon after class, I carried my bag (which contains my notebook) and went to the shopping complex in town. Well, it's not that my area doesn't have one shop or something, but the prices aren't too… reasonable. So I have to go a little bit further.

Anyway, just to avoid any heavy shopping bags, I went straight to the arcades first and have a few games of PPP. I didn't noticed that I'm attracting a crowd and at the end of the game, I get applause from the crowd. Gee, that's something I didn't experienced for a long while *^^*.

After that… ouch, the shopping bags are really heavy. Well, maybe to some, a shopping load of about 10kgs isn't too heavy, but it is to me because of my weak arms. Not to mention the notebook at my back… Well… as heavy as my stuff are, I'm glad that I manage to lift them back home without being breathless :p. But darn they are still heavy XD.

Back home, I cringe at the looks at my handphone, cause my T100's slider on the side seems to be stuck, it used to work perfectly when I got. In close inspection, I noticed that the slider has been fixed upside down, and I can't recall that anyone have tinkered with my phone… wait! I remembered! Should be the repair man two weeks ago! Oh god! That's really being shoddy >.<.

Not wanting to spend extra to get that fixed, I decide to fix it myself, But to be frank, I don't really trust myself, I still remembered my living skills classes where I totally suck at fixing stuff and slothering electronics. But then… I'm just being stingy. When I tried to fix it, I only notice that it needs a special kind of screw driver which should look something like a star. Oh darn! So basically I have been experimenting with various screwdriver like stuff in hopes that I can get the screws out. To my surprise, the file attached to the end of the nail clipper just does the job. Hmmm…

After getting the screws out, I can't seem to get the cover off. So I checked online in hopes there's some sort of solution, but the resources aren't much. And the only answer I get is "loosen out two latches to remove the antenna cover to reveal *two more screws*" and I'm like "WHAT LATCHES? I see no LATCHES!!!" XDDD Eventually I only notice the latches after some poking and tinkering, got that out… then the cover… readjust the slider… rescrew the darn thing… and it works like a charm now! ^^ Wee~ I never knew I can do that ^^.

As for now, I still can't wipe out my smirk which I carried since this afternoon though, apparently it seems that once you feel the crush on somebody, the brains and hormones will go all berserk. Well… think about it, it's a good feeling, since that proves that I still believe in love and I'm not giving up just yet. And I'm not going to settle for anything less (in terms of happiness) :p.

Well… I'm not ready to get out of the closet yet (well… at least I don't want more people than necessary to know about my bisexuality… umm, it seems like I'm getting more inclined to become gay though >.>. But then I still want to keep my options open). Besides, I do think I want to know Choon Hui (Umm… my current crush. I hope none of my course mates are reading this :p) a bit better, so I think I'll stick to my "observe and hint" mode for the time being… of course, this time I'm going to take every single chance to get near him. Well, at least getting such a smart and sexy (not exactly sexy by general public standard, but he's definitely my type <3) friend is not bad either if I ever decided not to hit that off the bat (Hah! Fat chance!).

Anyway, I'm just happy right now. I suppose I deserve that after a happiness drought :p. Guess I play some music to suit my mood, no prizes on guessing what song I'm into now :p.
