{% mark post -%}The rain is getting nastier by the day, and the wind is really relentless in some way. Bleh… I hate to mention about Malaysian weather, it&apos;s always either blazing hot or shivering cold (and wet) and by some rare chance you&apos;ll get nice weather.

While I&apos;m helping my friends out with their assignments, one of my friends remarks does made me quite embarrassed… And all of a sudden I feel that I didn&apos;t understand almost every one of my friends O_O". Seriously, it&apos;s like… I never understood them at all: their likes and dislikes, their personalities and reactions, bits and pieces of their personal life… Kinda remind me of one of Ayumi Hamasaki&apos;s song: Because of You (Umm… Is it? I vaguely remembered the meanings of the lyrics). Uhh… Now I don&apos;t think I understood Choon Hui that well either, which did made me feel like that I said the wrong things most of the time. >.>

I wonder whether I&apos;m just being hard on myself? I do need to have my perfectionism toned down a bit and take things a bit easy.

Anyway, I have been digging back all my game music MIDI and listening to it, now I kinda miss all the wonderful RPGs that I had played before. Guess I might dig those games back up some day. (especially FF6 <333){%- endmark %}
