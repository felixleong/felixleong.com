Phew! I never knew the other university block is THAT far! Took me about 20 minutes to walk there!

Anyway, there&apos;s a blood donation drive today and I just went there to support them ;). However, I have to walk to another university block since I missed the previous two blood donation drives when they held them in ours. It&apos;s been a year since I last donated blood, since it just happens that I fell sick the previous two donation drives. :(

I went there and the crowd and reception is really welcoming. The helpers there are extremely friendly, and it seems that there&apos;s a bunch of cute guys and gals studying over in that block. Damn I&apos;m so envious :p. The queue is really nasty, but luckily that it went so swift that I only have to wait for an hour before it&apos;s my turn.

After that everything just went smoothly and it didn&apos;t took me long to fill up my bag of blood. And it seems I got used to blood donation that it didn&apos;t took me a long time to recover from it. Hmm…. did I mention that the helpers are extremely friendly? :)

Anyway, I did well in my JAVA test yesterday. To my surprise (sort of), one of the test questions appears in our previous tutorial @_@". Weird~

Life&apos;s good… just have to wait until I started my Advanced Artificial Intelligence programming assignment :p.

[:: RANDOM STUFF ::]
- I only notice that I have a 3kg drop in weight, which means that I&apos;m now only 47kgs @_@". Uh… guess I need to find a way to gain some weight
- Going back to my hometown tomorrow, at least planning to, since I haven&apos;t got my bus tickets bought yet. But if I do manage to get home, I&apos;ll be able to relax with my family for a few days <333. Choon Hui will definitely be missed during the 3 days period =3
