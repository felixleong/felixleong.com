OK… just got over with my disappointment, and luckily I have pretty much prepared myself for events like this. I&apos;ll still treat him as a special friend, no matter what, and I still love him a lot. But… well… I just don&apos;t expect anything now from him except of being a good friend :). Too bad I have to fold this piece of fact and shove it underneath my head instead of airing it out and pass it to Choon Hui. I just wish that we can be great friends, if not better than that (which I originally intended to).

In other news, friends has been telling me that some girl has a crush on me @_@". Huh? Well… at least I feel a bit flattered. But then again, she would have to impress me :p… perhaps. Anyway, let&apos;s see what is in store for me later.

To be continued…
