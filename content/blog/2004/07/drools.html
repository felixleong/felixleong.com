{% mark post -%}Hmm… The fourth generation iPod looked so cool that I really wanted to buy one now, not to mention being better than the current iPod on sale now. The problem? It might take a few months before it actually reach the Malaysian shores ;___;.

So basically I can either wait until the new ones comes here (which might mean months), but have to resist the temptation for quite some time; or just get the 15GB model now and get over with it (but I have to pound myself for the extra 5 GB and the extra 4 hours battery life… which is not necessary but nice to have). Hmmmm…. that&apos;s a really tough decision to make. @_@"… But it&apos;s really tempting to have your music around with you everytime.

Anyway, thinking of dropping by to 1 Utama tomorrow and check out the bookstores… I might bump into some books which might be useful books for my final year project. Might drop by to MacAsia there as well… and there&apos;s a high possibility that I might lose the better-product/get-it-now dillema @_@", since the original iPod looked cool enough to me… but it might have the price drop in case the new iPods come to our shore. ARRRRGGGHHHHH~~~ The dillema XDDD.

Anyway, gotta finish my assignment, got some love-sickness to recover from today.{%- endmark %}
