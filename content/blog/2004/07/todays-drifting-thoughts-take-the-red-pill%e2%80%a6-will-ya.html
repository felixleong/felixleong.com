OK, the Internet have definitely being a total idiot for the past two days! (And I&apos;m SOOO close in using the F words now, but I&apos;ll just leave it as that)

For some apparent reasons, I just feel tired: physically and partially emotionally. I can explain the physical part, considering that having a lecture marathon isn&apos;t fun and having mid-terms and assignments lately does freaks me out for no reason (GOD! I just wished that I can snap out of it and take it easy). But for some reasons, I just can&apos;t seem to find a good pattern for my current emotional state. Yes, I would say that I am happier than before, but it seems that I can still see that there&apos;s parts of it being foggy and the other being shadowed by something in the past which I can&apos;t say which one for sure. Is it that I&apos;m starting to feel insecure about myself? Or is it that I feel that I&apos;m totally out of control in handling my own life? Or is it that I&apos;m being overly sensitive all for the wrong reasons?

There&apos;s just a lot of things that I have to clear up, and really… I just wished that I knew where to find help… ._.". The only thing I noticed is that this is not the first time I wrote about this in my LJ (now it seems to be more like a personal diary), and I just can&apos;t seem to string all these fragments together.

Sometimes I&apos;m just so pissed off about life in general, I don&apos;t know, I just hate to see great people (or at least those whom I believe that they are) suffering. OK, maybe it&apos;s only me being emotional after I catch up with three-days worth of LJ friends entries, but I&apos;m just… overwhelmed. Sometimes at times like this I just feel totally helpless, and when something happens to someone you know online, it just makes things tougher. For one thing I know:
- It&apos;s not that we have been together and know each other better (which is something that you can only achieve in real life)
- It&apos;s not that we can just understand someone based on the way that people write (it&apos;s part of it, but like many other visual cues it can be deceiving)
- It&apos;s not that we can know <b>the truth behind everything</b>

And yeah, about <b>the truth factor</b>, what is the truth anyway? Sometimes the truth that people is trying to feed us might be <b>one observation</b> towards one situation, just the thoughts of it spelt <b>drama</b> to me. But then, we as humans are a being of emotions. Sometimes I just think those emotions and human behaviour as a double edge sword: Worst being <b>"Trust"</b>. Trust is such a powerful gift to humans that forms the basis of human survival. Yet again, it so powerful that it&apos;s fatal to the owner once it gets misused by someone else.

Basically I&apos;m no paranoid, and sometimes I just so naive that I believe in intimate friends without any thoughts, doubts or question. I foresee myself bound to be hurt someday because of my weakness, yet I did took my paranoia into the extremes once that it really hurts in the end.

I just wish that I can just solve that mystery, but life is just full of mysteries that awaits to be solved.

I think I&apos;ll leave it as that for now, I believe that I&apos;ll come back to this someday. Just to lighten things up a bit, I have fun chatting with Dr Tay today, and Choon Hui is always a sweetie.

All hugs to Ben, Vicky and Ahmed for the things that have happened to you. I hope things would be better for you guys, and the only thing I can do now is to hope for the best and have unconditional faith in you guys that you&apos;ll be able to overcome the hurdles in life. May God bless you (as much as I don&apos;t really believe in a specific God, but it&apos;s the thought that counts, right?).

Felix signing off now. Take care of yourself.
