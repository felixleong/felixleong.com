I forgot my eBay password. Damn! And the "request password change" link doesn&apos;t work. Grrr…

Anyway, a good ayu-ro mix CD is auctioned for US$11.99 (not inclusive of US$3 shipping)… Slightly on the expensive side…

Anyway, here&apos;s the link:
http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&category=307&item=4026652698&rd=1&ssPageName=WDVW

What do you think about it?
[p/s: This is my first experience in dealing with eBay auctions, and I definitely can use with some help here. Pretty please? :) ]
