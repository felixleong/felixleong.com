First off…  HAPPY BIRTHDAY keii!!! ^^

Anyway, just went to the Para gathering today, and I hate to say that I&apos;m starting to suck in terms of scores ^^". I&apos;m trying some new Para style, which might be part of the reason ^^". And I can&apos;t believe that I suck in Pump It Up! Duh!

Met with Eric for the first time, who is a paralist from Kedah. And GOD he was good <333. He have the fluid body movements of the likes of a combination of Richie and Ryoko. Cool! Hopefully we get to see him next time round and practice with him, and I got one guy who finally know more dances than most of the members :p. (so I don&apos;t need to feel fed up with the same set of songs)

I kinda miss people in general since yesterday. Been thinking quite a lot of things lately about myself, you know, life, problems, things that I should have done/known better. Stuff like that. And I just came to think of Choon Hui, I&apos;m pretty much lost when I thought about him: He&apos;s a really fantastic friend, but I want him as someone more than that. But I might run into a risk that he might avoid me once he knows my sexuality and stuff, which is the worst senario that I don&apos;t want, as well as the biggest risk I have to take in case I want to pour it out. I don&apos;t want that to happen considering that… he&apos;s one of the best friends that I ever had.

I&apos;m thinking of taking Coach Vee&apos;s advice earlier and pose the question indirectly. Thinking of doing it tomorrow, but if he had already sensed my attraction towards him, the message would be <i>really</i> direct (no matter how hard I try to mask it), which in turn would trigger the risk factor.

God I&apos;m confused… Just hope for the best tomorrow.
