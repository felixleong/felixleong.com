Going to the bookstore with Choon Hui is definitely priceless <333. *^-^* I&apos;ll just leave it as that (Refer to yesterday&apos;s thread for that one). Got myself a few more books, which includes <b>another</b> book on Japanese. Gosh with all those books I wonder why I still haven&apos;t get a good grasp of the language XDDD. <i>(*the voice inside: Take the time to READ them)</i>

In other news, I won the auction for ayu-ro CD <333, Paypal have already charged my debit card… so I guess I just have to wait until the CD shipped to me. (Hope it&apos;ll be soon)

Well… I think I got too full with Choon Hui now. Perhaps I might need some time to digest it. Now I just need to make sure I keep tabs with my obsessiveness or else it might drag me to another dark void of depression.
