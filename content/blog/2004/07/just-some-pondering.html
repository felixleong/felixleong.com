First off, some unrelated stuff:
- Sent my cash to CDJapan today, just hope that the CD arrives within a month… or at least the cash being sent there safely
- Unexpected rains in Malaysia (umm… I guess it has to do with the monsoon season) really sucks
- The wireless Internet access at school doesn&apos;t work today. ARGH!
- Two mid-terms tomorrow… *dies*
- *stomps self for Choon Hui related stuff*

OK, been having some deep conversation with Steven today, and then I was pretty much left with some thoughts today. Well… I do have improve a lot in communicating and interacting with other people, just that it needs more polish. But what have made me ponder is that… well… I just have some feeling that I&apos;m missing something from my puzzle. It seems that most of the time, my identity is pretty much built by what others have envisioned me to be. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I liked the person of whom I am now, just that…  I just don&apos;t feel like myself, in one way. It seems that there&apos;s one gap in my own identity that I don&apos;t know of.

… I just don&apos;t know what it is… guess I might put my thoughts into drifting mode one day.

Anyway… in other news… OMG! Someone from my university saw my journal! *dies* I don&apos;t know whether I should put XDDD or ^_^". Anyway… well… I&apos;ll just leave it as that.
