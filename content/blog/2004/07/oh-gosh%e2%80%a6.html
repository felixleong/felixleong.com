{% mark post -%}Gah! My webcam is spoilt! >.<" Ugh… How am I suppose to film my choreos without a cam! Duh… Well… Looking at the bright side of things, at least I can buy myself a better webcam… but… Augh! That&apos;s gonna bang my budget again. Well… guess I can just wait ;___;.

Being lovesick again, which is OK until the destructive thoughts starts to flood my brain. That&apos;s not fun. Gotta love Lolita&apos;s Heart Attack, it always blast my negative thoughts away. (Well, I just can&apos;t control it when I hear "You&apos;ll be my scrambled eggs" XDDDD) And funny thing is that I suddenly found ideas to choreo the dance (Yeah, I KNOW velfarre have already choreo&apos;d it), and surprisingly 75% went pretty well. :) Downside, my Go Go&apos;s and The Monkeys para got screwed up XDDD.

But guess I do have time to refine my dance before I get another webcam.{%- endmark %}
