{% mark post -%}Phew, just came back from the dinner with Erika and the gang, and the experience is totally fun <333.

Anyway, it didn&apos;t started off well initially, since just after the test, we went to Erika&apos;s apartment to have some rest there. And just all of a sudden, Su Hu, Erika and Vico doesn&apos;t feel well. But we do have some fun chatting with Erika&apos;s room-mates, Rachael and Chas… ummm, what&apos;s the name again, (XDDD) ah! Just call her by her nickname for now, Jiff :LOL:. Then Erika did asked whether I would like to try a love fortune telling with playing cards, and I&apos;m like… why not? The reading… at least to myself, came out quite accurate… She mentioned that my cards shows that I really approach "her" (actually it&apos;s a "him"… I wonder whether Erika would read this o_O") a lot lately, and I do have great interest and feelings towards "her", and there&apos;s a pretty strong third party as well. My luck is pretty neutral now, but she interprets that I should continue the relationship that way since "she" does have feelings for me, as much it wasn&apos;t as strong as mine.

Hmm… in one way, it hearing the last part of it does make me feel relieved… but just that… in this scenario, I might be the third party to Choon Hui&apos;s relationship. Maybe I&apos;m just analysing too much… But then, just hear from Choon Hui that he&apos;s going back to his home town, and if I didn&apos;t heard him wrong previously, his girlfriend did came back from Australia now for a while. I just…. I think I better leave it as that, I&apos;ll just continue with my plans.

Later on at 8, we have to bring Su Hu to the clinic, but we can&apos;t seem to find one parking spot after several turns around the area. Then when Vico manage to find one and we thought we are extremely lucky (since it&apos;s only next to the clinic), Vico banged into two parked motorbikes behind… and… duh ._.". The car is OK, but Vico have to fork out some money for the damage. All that is enough to dampen the mood for steamboat.

So instead, we just went into one nearby Chinese restaurant instead. And the only problem is… It just seems that I&apos;m the only person who is able to make the orders. And we do have a language barrier there since our Indian friends (Vico, Erika and Jiff) doesn&apos;t understand Cantonese at all. So pretty much time is wasted just being translator. And we took so much time on that the waiter gave us a menu instead XDDD. God why didn&apos;t I knew that earlier! XDDD Anyway, ordered three dishes and we were there, sitting round a table and chat and joke like no end there.

I really had fun during the dinner, we were like chatting on various topics, from school to TV shows that we liked during our childhood days, and on and off we had lots of jokes going on that really make me laugh to the point that it hurts :LOL:. The one joke getting the spotlight being the time when we talk about driving experience and when we mention about automatic versus manual transmission cars, I pretty much made a random joke like, "WHERE&apos;S THE CLUTCH?!!! I WANNA BRAAAAAAKE!!!!!!" XDDDD And after that, it became the catch phrase during the joke sessions XDDD. They even suggested that we should have a rap song named "Where&apos;s the clutch?" with breakdance choreographs XDDDD.

Now I&apos;m at home, slightly exhausted but extremely happy as well. It&apos;s been quite a while since I experience pure fun hanging out with friends last time, and I&apos;m enjoying every single minute of it. Now I kinda miss my high school friends. Anyway, I think I do need to sign off now, and tomorrow will be another busy day =3.{%- endmark %}
