Hmm… let&apos;s see, some of my friends are commenting that I looked so different today that I looked great… and I didn&apos;t do anything special to my appearance, except that I just change a new bottle of shampoo (a pretty inexpensive one, but somewhat I feel that my hair is softer for some reasons).

And some other friends are asking why I&apos;m smiling like an idiot today (meaning: smiling a lot more than usual), which I don&apos;t really can find an answer to. Maybe I&apos;m just happy to be around with some friends? Or is it that I get to see more of Choon Hui today? Hmm…

Halfway through I just have those "I seem that I don&apos;t understand anybody, including my friends" blues, but I suppose that&apos;s normal sometimes. Some chit-chat does help to ease that out.

Looking forward for Wednesday to come, because Erika and her gang are asking me out for dinner, and I like to join them a lot since we have so many things to talk about and their jokes always brighten my day =3.

And yeah! My brother and sister just got their MUET (Malaysian Unversity English Test…. or something, which is pretty much similar to TOEFL) results and they get Band 5! (highest being 6) I&apos;m <b>SOOO</b> proud of them :). Other than that, things are getting pretty good, and hope this continues :).
