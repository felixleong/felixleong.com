Gah! For some reasons the Internet is getting REALLY sluggish @\_@". Add the fact that I'm on dialup with makes matters 1000 times worse. *Slaps!*

Anyway, I'm planning to get the latest distribution of Inkscape now… ;\_\_\_\_;. I don't wanna wait an hour to get it downloaded ;\_\_\_\_\_\_;.

Here's another cover art I have done… honestly… it wasn't much different from the previous design so most probably I would have dump this away. But I do had fun doing the kerning and letter spacing stuff. So I'm still pretty much experimenting the features in Inkscape. Hopefully I'll go… somewhere with it XDDD.

In other news, all of a sudden someone emailed saying that he really liked my manga site… which I haven't been maintaining it like… YEARS? XDDD And currently with Freewebsites.com being "blergh~, that person offered me some webspace to host my site on :). Pretty cool! ^^b. Hmm… I suppose it doesn't hurt to give it a try, shouldn't I? Hmmm….

Oh yeah, I NEARLY forgot, Erika and Steven came to my house, and THANK YOU Steven for all the off-colour jokes *is sarcastic >:p* XDDDD.
