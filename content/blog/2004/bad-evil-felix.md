Heh heh, being naive is totally evil, nuff says.

OK, enough of my random quotes (err… I think I randomly made that up), but I decided to let my wildness lose a little and put my over-rationalizing nature into a cage. So… basically I took a new hobby for myself: I put myself in "hunting and flirty mode". It's not totally go all out or doing anything serious or extreme, I just loosen myself a little and try to look at who's hot and who's not in our class. That's pretty much a very welcoming and refreshing change considering the fact that I've been either planting myself in work or my own ex-crush depression during the past.

And funny thing is that now I noticed hot guys (and a few girls) that I previously had overlooked in the past. Woo, kind of miss those increasing heartbeat sensation for quite a long time ;). Glancing back to my ex-crush, he's still hot, but I finally able to let my previous clinging go and enjoy such a good friend I had.

However the only problem is that now the flirty side of me started to invade some of my forums posts and IM chats, I'm feeling like I'm dropping hints to everyone now. Guess I better control myself a bit and don't create any unnecessary drama. :p (Or am I too late? Mua ha ha~)

Other than that, as long as I don't remind myself that there's assignment dues next Monday, it'll continue to be fun. (Darn! I did it again!) Better get back to school work!
