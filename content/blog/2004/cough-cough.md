Stupid allergies with dust, moist air… and mosquito repellent X(!

Anyway, my aunt's doing some spring cleaning at the guest room, which is rarely used. So you can imagine a musty room, vacuum cleaners… and DUST! Augh!!! >.<" And my throat isn't feeling that well now… Well… at least my allergies are getting better lately. >.>

Now I better find a way to either get immuned to the mosquito repellent or the nasty mosquito bites.
