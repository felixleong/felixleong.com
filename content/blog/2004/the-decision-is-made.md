After the recent events occurring, I already made up my mind that I'll give it another chance. (So… Erika, that will be my own reply :) )

However… I can't believe that two chances have been blown in a mere two days.

For those who don't understand why I say "chances", it has something to do with my own *Three Chances Principle*. Basically for any occasion, I'm extremely lenient with mistakes, especially those involve others or made by others. However, I always set my bar at 3 chances, and once these chances are used up, it'll make me take serious action regarding that issue.

Of course, that doesn't mean that more chances can't be given to a person to make up a past mistake, but has to be earned.

So, coming back to this issue, the first chance is pretty much blown by myself: which has been pretty much what that has been making me depressed and thinking a dang lot during the past two days.

I'm not going to disclose what had happened yesterday which blew up the second chance, however, what I'm able to say about it is that: I take every single word extremely seriously, spoken or written. Even if it were to be a joke, I take them into account as well because every single word blurted out is a reflection of your own attitude and personality. And anything that has to do regarding a person's life and death is something that I find extremely NOT funny. In fact I take them so seriously that I'll take the extra mile to do whatever necessary to make sure that everything is all right.

To keep it short: It's extremely hard for me to care someone who didn't love, or at least cared for themselves in the first place. It's perfectly OK to have depression once in a while, it's perfectly OK to have a nervous breakdown once in a while, it's perfectly OK to feel weak once in a while.

But for those who can't treasure their own lives and mentioning death like nobody's business is definitely EXTREMELY irresponsible. Do you know how much you mean to somebody else? Do you know how much people loved and cared for you? Do you know that how much impact will it cause to somebody else?

…

All I can say is… what had happened yesterday has made me so stressed out that… it's really tiring. It's so tiring that… it really took me quite some serious consideration before I made my own decision. I just have to say that I'm also a human being as well, I can only take that much tension on my own.

So… that's pretty much it. I have to do some school work now, since I can't do anything tomorrow because of work. But seeing that this issue is resolved, the next entry will be public as usual :). And yeah, doing public entries make me happy :D.
