Woke up at 10 today, feeling rejuvenated, and the shock factor that has been haunting me for the past few days has pretty much faded away. It's a good thing. :) Just as soon as I open the door of my room, I noticed a note from my aunt: telling me to tidy up my room since there'll be guest staying in my room when I'm staying with my parents. Hmm… OK, but just as soon I turn my head around… AUGH! My room is a total mess: With all my washed clothes piled up in one bed, paperwork scattered around the floor and more scraps of paper on the table, unwashed plates and plastic containers with crumbs on the table… Umm… really, it's not a good sight. Not to mention the the floor hasn't been swept for so long that dust has been carpeting the floor.

So, cleaning time! I pretty much have to turn my room upside down in order to clear up all the mess, and it took me about an hour to finally get everything look clean and organized. And I'm pretty much proud of it now. Hope the guest didn't mess it up again XD, cause I really liked the sight of my "new" room. Looking at the clock, oh my! It was almost close to 12! I hastily packed my stuff and rushed out the house.

First stop is to get some money out from the bank, and then go to my phone operator's customer service centre to ask whether I can get a replacement SIM for my phone (I don't really feel like losing my phone number, it's pretty much been with me for 3 years). Too bad they said that I have to replace it at their headquarters and they aren't open today. Ah well. It's not a big deal, I guess. Then I hopped on the LRT and get to Pudu bus station, left my printer there at the luggage centre, and went to Time Square to meet up with Hang. And he's really glad to see the CDs that I have bought him. And now I had enough cash to buy a new phone.

After that, I spent two hours at the mall looking for a really cheap phone, which IS really hard, since new phone almost have a starting price tag of above 300 without registering a fixed line. I wanted a prepaid plan instead and that really sucks. So I have to settle with a second hand phone with a cheap SIM card to go with it. It's quite nice to see that I can settle it off below 300 bucks, since I'm REALLY cash strapped right now.

Sensing that it's almost time to head back to the bus station to catch my bus, I quickly walk all the way back (cough… wish I do can afford to hire a taxi instead XD). And when I'm boarding the bus, I saw someone really familiar… but I can't seem to remember who that is. As soon as she said "Hi!", I instantly recognized her voice and OMG! She's my favourite English teacher during high school and she looked SO different with casual wear! XD Apparently she's having a nice trip in KL (Kuala Lumpur) with her children. Get to chat with her for a while later and then I'm sitting there alone on my seat (too bad teach sat too far away from where I'm sitting).

The three hours and a half journey alone is a really good time to be introspective. Somewhat the rob scene still flashes in my mind and I started to reflect myself a bit. Well, now I do feel a bit stupid for not reporting to the police… ah well, guess that serves me a good lesson. But then, I'll try to avoid the mistake that I made last time anyway. Then I thought a lot about my own actions and reactions and stuff, I working a lot of action plans on my head… I do wonder whether I'm able to use them confidently when I'm confronted with unexpected events. But anyway, it's kind of meaningful in some way.

When I reached home, I met with the parents of a friend of mine, it seems that he's going back to Kelantan to participate in one camp, and his family is sending him off. Then his father offered to send me home, and I guess I got lucky :p. And now I'm sitting at the comfort of my own home typing all this, my family is as warm as usual, not to mention that everyone's is now at home now (since my brother is having his holidays as well). It's just heart-warming staying at home, guess I might feel reluctant to go back when it's time :p.

Well… time for some sleep. Good night everyone ;).
