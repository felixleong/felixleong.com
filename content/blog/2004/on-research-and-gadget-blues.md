Phew… finally, a week over :).

Anyway, the good thing about participating in university research groups is that you might get a chance to try those new gadgets in the market. This time we get to have our hands on [Logitech's ioPen](http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm?page=products/usertype/businesstopics&CRID=1912&parentCRID=267&contentID=7333&countryid=34&languageid=1) for our research. :D It might not sound cool compared to those gadgets in MIT or Carnegie Melon, but at least for gadget deprived people like me, that's something cool enough! :D

However, there are some frustration that kicks in: My laptop doesn't seem to detect the digital pen! Gah… guess I'm still trying to figure it out what's wrong with my computer settings (cause it works in my professor's computer).

Work is starting to pile up and I'm starting to shift some gears now! Till then, I'm wishing the best of luck for myself.
