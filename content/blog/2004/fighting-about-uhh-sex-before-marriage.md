title: Fighting About… Uhh… Sex Before Marriage?

Yesterday night isn't really a good night to me due to the fact that I get all freaked out and stressed to the point that I'm feeling like locking myself in somewhere where I'm totally isolated from anything for a few days. During those depressing times, it's pretty tough not to think you are really unloved and helpless. Even kind requests of help from friends get annoying during times like that. And the worst thing is that the crappy feeling is still there when I woke up!

Anyway, I did feel a little better now after having a hot debate with my group about our Moral and Ethics assignment. Well… the topic is about sexual relationship between marriage and I have to be the opposition! Gah! That was tough, and it's pretty obvious that I can't win, since the morality point of view against it is pretty fragile compared to the current views that supports it. Nonetheless it did relieve my stress since I get to argue, shout and be a little bit violent.

And now… back to my assignments again…
