Augh! Didn't fare well for today's exams, I just do some calculations and estimate that I had lose enough marks to kiss an A goodbye. Gosh… I'm really feeling like plunking my head on the keyboard. But I can't worry about that now, got six more subjects on the line… and I'm not confident in every single one of them. Darn… lousiest semester. >\_<" I suppose I had only myself to blame for my lack of preparation.

Anyway, to make things worse, my friend is going on the complain drive, it's starting to drive me up the roof. He had his point and most of them are pretty much valid, but really I don't feel like hearing a lot of them. It's just tiring. Anyway, I got two more days to do whatever I have to do, I guess I might show up tomorrow for the gathering some stress relief, but I don't think I'll stay there for long (unless I would like to risk my CGPA sliding down the drain.

And… um… I'm just… tired… dead tired.

Which should be last if you had this statement: "The last entry is 70 followed by 80"??? I say 80, but there're people arguing for 70. What's your views on this?
