It's still the holidays, but I just decided to come back a little bit earlier. Love sick is sometimes a weird thing :p.

Anyway, I'm starting to plan what to do… as much as I know that anything I plan would usually end up being screwed up. :p Watashi/Boku wa Nihongo o benkyou shimasu <3. Yes! I'm starting to learn Japanese, self taught though. Thinking of taking the Japanese course organized by our university, but Choon Hui doesn't seem interested to join ;\_;. Well… I really can't think of any other friend who wants to join me, might as well go alone if that's the scenario.

Well… I'm thinking of working or something actually, but then I would really love to spend more time in the project lab to finish my final year project stuff. Currently scouting for some part-time job which I can do during the weekends, but somewhat the reminder that I'm extremely clumsy seems to hold me back… Think I'll try my best to find courage to earn some extra cash for a new digital camera (yes! I finally decided not to buy one just yet)

Going to the computer shop tomorrow to get a new 56k modem back home, since I can't get online without my laptop around for the time being. Maybe I might get myself a memory card and a card reader as well, just to act something like a pen drive (and a preparation to use it as my camera memory in the future).

As for today, I'll be going to the programming workshop with Choon Hui, most probably I won't be with him alone (apart from the accompanying lecturer), but that's OK as long I'm with him :).

Gotta go now! :)

Oh yeah! LJ Spam of the day! :)
