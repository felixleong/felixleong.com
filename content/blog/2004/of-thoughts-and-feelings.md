In the moment of silence, I'm starting to notice that there's a lot of things to do, a lot of responsibility to pick up, an adventure to the unknown is starting to be embarked…

It might not cause much significance to the lifes of others of my own, but I believe through this trail will open the doors to what I seek.

This… is the beginning.
