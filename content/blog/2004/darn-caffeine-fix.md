GAH~~~ I knew that caffeine is responsible for the stimulating effect, but I never knew that I'm really bad in taking it as much as I can't stand small amounts of alcohol (it makes me all turning red and groggy even I only took 1/20 of a cup of wine)! And now, just one cup of those 3-in-1 coffee mixes is making me all hyper and horny, and I have no place to release the sudden gush of energy! (Unlike going to have a java fix in a coffee shop near a shopping complex that I can walk around)

MYAAAAAAAAAAH~ Darn! I really don't know what to do now? Although I only intended to have coffee to make myself more awake while reading my school texts, I can't seem to concentrate after that! Guess I need some time to let it fade a bit… but then again… Blah!
