It's funny that Chinese does have a tendency to say that a song is about a sad story when they doesn't understand the lyrics (Is Ayumi's Voyage sad? Umm… Maybe not). Does makes me wonder…

Other than that, I'm going to a collab with Nine! Woo oo ooo~ Can't wait to see how it turns out. :3 And then, Tommy (in MYPPF) is tempting me with surprises so that I can forget about my homework and go to the gathering instead… As much as I don't really feel like it (since I need to finish some assignments), my heart is still tickling to know what that was. Till then, I'm facing a radiation source doing Powerpoints. There :p
