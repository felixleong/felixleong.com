Yay for Coach Vee in sending this <3. Now I really think of venturing into older Eurobeat someday :).

Today's pretty much a slow day… I woke up *very* late today, 1:30 in the afternoon, to be exact. @\_@ The printer service staff wasn't here today, which does somewhat make me quite furious >.<". Think I might give them another call tomorrow.

So as expected, my mood isn't getting anywhere from cheery lately… you know, with all those spoilt hardware lying around and extremely annoying warranty claims to make. OK, maybe I shouldn't be that bothered, but then again that thought isn't getting anywhere from lifting my moods up. :(

Anyway, just now I just came back from my aunt's wedding dinner (2nd round :) ). The food is great :), but now I'm not feeling that well for some reasons… maybe I just had too much meat, considering that I'm a partial vegetarian now.

Anyway, gotta sleep early today because tomorrow's my appointment with our project supervisor… and to be honest I feel a bit bad because it seems that I didn't do anything yet :(. But looking at the bright side of things Choon Hui will be there tomorrow, so yeah :).

Till then… anyone knows how to cure a down-ish mood now? (otherwise a hug would do)
