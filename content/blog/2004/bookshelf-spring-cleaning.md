Just clearing out my bookshelf just now so that I can fit my books in. Shoved away all my previous lecture notes somewhere, and stack them nicely so that I can dump them to my juniors, rearrange some of the books and now my room is much more tidier… mum, at least the bookshelf XDD.

Then I only noticed that my books have almost taken the whole shelf already @\_@". Gosh… how much books I have bought lately… And I have a lot of books lent to my friends! Gosh I need another bookshelf.

On an unrelated note, filmed a few more videos today <333. I have been forming ideas for Go Go's And The Monkeys, I have finished with the choreograph, but I'm not too satisfied with it that I'm still tweaking some minor details.

Phew! Got more work to do now ^^. Oh yeah, I need to get more protective sheets for my books.
