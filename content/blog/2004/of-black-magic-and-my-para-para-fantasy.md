Yes! Tommy and I (and a few more members) are going to form our own Para Para group soon! ^\_^ Our team name will tentatively be called My Para Para Fantasy. The "MY" part is really fun because it's also the country code for Malaysia :D. Hopefully everything would go well and we get more Paralist down here in South East Asia.

Oh yeah, I'm feeling a little bit better now and I just film [Black Magic](http://felixleong.freewebsites.com/videos/blackmagic.wmv) (choreograph: velfarre). Go ahead and download it!

*Yawn* Gotta get some sleep. Ja'ne!

[p/s: Thanks for TaQ for the corrections!]
