Guess what I found in the CD shop today ^^! move's REWIND «single collection+«, and what's sweeter is that it's the first pressing limited edition disc set together with a DVD with their PVs <3. Imagine the internal struggle that I go through because I have been spending way too much on CDs lately ^^". But I got the CD and it's MIIIINE XD.

Here's the CD cover ;) (with the booklet on your right):

(Ignore the green, PG sticker by the Singapore's censorship board XD)

Anyway, I'm just wondering:

- What music genre should move's music be categorized into? I believe that it's not J-Pop all right <.<. Anyone can help? (prods Dom)
- Who's the model in the covers anyway! XD I remember that usually move always appeared in most of their album covers, and this time it seems like it's a model with some fake, wooly hair instead. Hmm…

Damn! I wish for a DVD player ;\_;. (Guess I have to make an appointment with someone who has it :p)

School starts tomorrow, and I hope for a great start this semester ^^.
