Wee… Three entries in one day! XD That's getting rare lately :p.

Anyway, as much as I was hoping that it's not going to rain… it does, in a REALLY big way. If you need something to relate to, imagine a nasty storm which would have let you feel like you are in the set in The Day After Tomorrow, minus the large hails, tsunami etc. It's that bad.

And worse, I HATE ACID RAIN! And I would never see a BBQ curry taste junk food the same way again, judging that the rain smell like it. And it's a big ouch when you have one of those slight burning feeling while being hit by one of those innocent-looking raindrops.

So now I'm stuck in Starbucks in hope that it'll stop soon. Have their coffee of the day today (Today's Verona), and I'm sipping it from the cup while looking at the nasty storm outdoors… Which is… really a stark contrast with the comfy setting in Starbucks.

Anyway, Allen sent me this song… and it's really relaxing, for one thing ^^.
