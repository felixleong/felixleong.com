Me and Kong Meng (Michael… umm, hope I got that right o_O").

Yong Ling, me, a coursemate which I don't know his name (O\_O"") and Moa Kit.

These were taken in front of the Putrajaya Convention Centre, FYI.

As for today… I don't know, I just feel tired. School has literally drain my energy to the max. Well… it's still enjoyable with friends and stuff, but I just feel totally unproductive once I get home, which is not too good.

Took my nap just now, I *should* be OK now. Computer Society membership drive booth is going to be opened tomorrow, hope it gets more response and members than last time, because it's embarrassing to see less than 20 members in the society o\_O".

Signing off now. Now I just need a cure for being lethargic most of the day.
