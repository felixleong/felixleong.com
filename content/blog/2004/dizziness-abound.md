"Along the busy streets of Petaling Jaya, I always have to pass through a highway where all you can see is concrete… well, almost.

On the road shoulder right next to a traffic light, there's a potted plant placed there, and these little flowers always seems to catch my attention during a busy day. Perhaps it's because it's a small yet special patch of green among the greys? Or maybe they are just plain cute to look at :)."

Yesterday wasn't much, just spent time changing dressing for my wound, typing away to get one pesky assignment off my shoulder, and as well as film some new choreographs ^^. I feel so like a slut when I choreo'ed Lolita's Cherry Girl XD, but I really liked the end result. So yeah, I do need a decent compy to edit the videos ;\_\_\_;.

Just notice that my CODS (Crush Over-Dwelling Syndrome, for the uninitiated) for Choon Hui did somewhat fade away, which is a good thing… in one way of looking at it. I don't know, it seems that I have a feeling that… My happiness doesn't solely revolve/depends on him. Well, I still like him no matter what, but just that the feeling just seems to take another form? Or maybe I'm not good enough to differentiate the complex feelings inside me? I'm not extremely sure, but well, life is a journey of understanding one self, right? ;) (and so far I'm enjoying the ride)

Today's a great yet normal day, apart from the constant itch from my wound, which is annoying but that signifies its healing. Everything went fine until late afternoon when I just have a nasty throbbing headache. >.<" And I do feel a bit sickly right now. Oh great…

Anyway, other small stuff includes me being the main designer in this coming Orientation committee, and I will be designing art stuff :)… And Choon Hui was my leader so-yeah-I'm-happy XD. There's a presentation tomorrow to present my 20%-completed Java assignment, and that really sounds like a train wreck to me… just hope I can pull that through without having our group marks going rock-bottom.

Ah well… let's just see how things turn out tomorrow. My study plans/exam preparations starts today so no sudden surprises this time. And on an unrelated note… I have yet to grab Parapara NINE video off! >.<" (Downloading it now, BTW)

[:update note:]

I was thinking of catching up some LJ friends entry, but my head hurts so badly now that I can't reading more than a few paragraphs T-T. And without my laptop, I virtually can't manage the sheer amount of entries which I have left out.

So… I might not be commenting that much as I used to, but I just hope that you guys understand that I still care as long you are in my list. Take care, guys ^-^b.
