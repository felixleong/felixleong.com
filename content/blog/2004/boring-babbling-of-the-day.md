title: Boring Babbling of The Day

The day didn't start in a chipper way: Still feel like crying when I woke up, Allen feeling a bit disappointed by a Meme from my journal, weather is blazing hot, didn't feel comfortable in doing my reading at school, two buses pass by me before I can make it to a really nearby bus stop… Well, it's just not a day anyone would really feel optimistic about, but it's not really gloomy though.

But just before I stride my way home, I just decided to drop by the bank and apply for online banking service. Just as soon as I opened the door, the cool air starts to blow on my face, a real pleasure during a really hot day. And not to mention that the temperature is just right. Then I just sit there, waiting for my sweat to dry up while having my eyes browsing around the clean and tidy workspace those bankers had. I wish my room was that tidy :p, the bank seems to have a good environment to work, having some plants here and there, paperwork and stationery is organized in a way which is really tidy and pleasant in a way that they don't yell at you when you have unfinished work, nice chatty staff…

Then I just approach the customer service counter, having a friendly female staff helping me out with my application. Everything was done in such a friendly and swift manner that that alone has somewhat brighten up my day (not enough to make me feel all fresh and good, but that does makes me feel good).

Well… now I'm back home doing the rest of the procedure (keying in the pin and register a username, stuff like that), and thanks to Public Bank (PJ New Town) staff for making my day. (And god! I thought bankers are boring people :p)
