I'm starting to hate my notebook: It always gets overheated at the wrong time. But that's not the exact problem which I would want to scream my lungs out. The good thing about this notebook is that when it reaches a certain temperature, it'll automatically shut down the computer, which is a good thing because you don't want to see your processor melt like butter on top of a pancake. But the downside of it is that I turns off the notebook abruptly, Which is a good place to corrupt your files.

So in the morning, just out of the blue I feel like changing the genre of all my Eurobeat MP3s from "Eurodance" to "Eurobeat". Sounds simple, right? But masstagging about hundreds of MP3 is a really tedious task, so I use one of those nifty tools to do the trick. Everything goes fine until my notebook complains and shuts down all by itself halfway through the tagging process. ARGH!!!! How frustrating that was!

The fun doesn't ends there though. Apparently some of my MP3 got corrupted in the process that I have to dig my CD out and rerip the whole damn thing all over again! Ouch! Not to mention that I have to do the tedious taggings and stuff. Thank god MP3 Book Helper is of really good use here. Saves me from being bald in the first place.

Rants aside, I finally got myself MAX's MAXIMUM GROOVE, which contains the full version of the cover of Virginelle's Don't You Love Me. *^^* I think I'll upload the MP3 soon. :)

Till thenâ€¦ *see the stack of CDs on my table* AUGH!
