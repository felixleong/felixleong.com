Greatâ€¦. the eBay customer service representative isn't of any help, and someone used my e-mail address to flood a Yahoo! Group which I started myself, causing my Yahoo! e-mail being labelled as a Auto-Responder and I can't participate in any our course related Y!Group. (GOD! I got labelled for a crime which I didn't commit!)

WTF?!!!
