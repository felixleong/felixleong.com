title: Freaking Out… AGAIN!

Sometimes I just hoped that I can take things much more easier than I do, but people like me who have nervous energy in abundance, I just can't help it (I'm STILL trying to control it though). Even Ms Alugu (my Interpersonal Communication tutor) said that I looked too serious @\_@".

Well, longer story:

- The computer society booth is up now, but the turnout is STILL lousy. Not to mention that I have to skip one class to take care of the counter. Our society logo is lost, and it's a BAD idea to use card castles to attract attention… well, they do attract a lot of attention, just that rebuilding it after every collapse is painful. I just hate committees who didn't do their responsibilities
- SCHOOLWORK & ASSIGNMENTS!!! Period.

Well… the only way I can think to cool myself down is to seclude myself for a while to keep my attention on somewhere else, which I did by going to the TIMES bookstore warehouse sale again. Snagged some more books (my classic fiction now includes Black Beauty, The Adventure of Tom Sawyer and Robinson Crusoe) and met a few friends there.

Feel better now, just need some time to finish up part of my assignment. Might as well finish off the other half of Peter Pan which I left off yesterday (I might need to read it again to understand it better).
