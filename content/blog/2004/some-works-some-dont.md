title: Some Works, Some Don't

Today is just another mixed day: Happiness mixed with frustration. Anyway, there are just something that didn't work out right today, not really that serious: my latest sig into Netscape's web space, my research project's program down, a test that I should know but I don't (forgot to do my readings :p).

But the good thing is that I just got a Nokia pen for research purposes (which WORKS, unlike the Logitech one), got my assignment groups aligned (a little), and a holiday tomorrow. :D But I can't do much other than catching with my school work though :p. Anyway, it's still great to have some time for myself.

Random thoughts of the day:

1. Somewhat I still feel that my past hurts are still there, but think about it, it's more like strong emotions which has no where to be expressed. Unexpressed love, fears, gratefulness, hatred…
2. Cocky friends, and whether negative kind of obsession of things/hobbies/passion would make you selfish and sick. I don't know… but what I do know is that I did commit that kind of offence, and it's pretty much true…
