Nothing much happened, but here's a rundown of what happened yesterday:

- Bought a new barebones desktop (i.e. Just the CPU) with one grand Malaysian Ringgit. *icky-achy heart* But the only consolation I can give to myself is that I got a DVD combo drive > I can enjoy the DVDs I had.
- Halfway on my journey home, I notice that I left my bag in the restaurant o\_O". So there I go, going all the way back while it's drizzling outside (and with the heavy CPU on my hands), then walking for quite a distance with the heavy burden. Luckily my bag is still there.

    Moral of the story: It's better to have a car when you decided to shop for anything heavy.

    And I definitely need a cure for absent-mindedness.

- I don't know whether my DVD combo drive is trying to be funny, or it's the set of CDs that I had, I just can't get any OSes to be installed in my new compie! X(

    Hope it works today >.>

As for today, it'll be pretty much the same: figuring out how to get the computer up and running, as well as doing some research for my final year project stuff.

If I posted anything tonight, it means that my computer is done :).
