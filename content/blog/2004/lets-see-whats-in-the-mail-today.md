Well… Let's see… I got an e-mail from my ex-crush… umm, friend. For an unmentioned recap, I sent an e-mail to my ex-crush two days before as a result of unable to hold back the feeling I had for him. And… well, I got his reply, saying that we can still be friends. And… yes, I do feel crushed, but I'm much more prepared for it this time. Well… at least I can now take a deep breath and lock the possibility away for sure. At least rest assured that with the definite answer, I don't have to hurt myself as hard as I had done the past two years… hopefully.

So today I almost spent the whole afternoon reading Harry Potter: The Order of The Phoenix, and pretty much unlike the first four books in the series, this one is much darker. Hmm… This is interesting, I have flipped through a quarter of it and I'm pretty much sank into the fantasy world. I wonder whether I can marathon this one like I did with the previous Harry Potter books and the finale of Lord of The Rings (Return of The King). One thing for sure is that at least I have some sort of distraction from the heartaches and headaches I had for quite some time.

Then the next thing is less pleasant: I got my phone bill today and I certainly have scored a new record with my exorbitant Internet usage (look ma! I learn another big word XD). Ouch! Guess I have to unplug myself a little from the Internet now before it get worse. And my tuition fees for this semester is killing me!

Hmm… Other than that, I'm still waiting for my stuff from Dom (Yay for leftover money XD), and possibly something from Phil. So yay for plain old snail mail :p.
