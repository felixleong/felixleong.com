Um… really… Am I?

Anyway, it always seemed that I worry to much on a lot of things. Well… especially when I'm dealing with things which is beyond my control. This morning I woke up worrying about my parcels, especially the new batch of books being addressed to my aunt's house. Next was a parcel of CDs which I don't even know whether it got sent yet (as much as I trusted that it will be)…. and lastly a few letters which I'm expecting to receive sometime later. I don't know… In the age that everything has to be really fast, good old snail mail is still slow… well, it's fast enough though. I wonder how was it like during the old days, where postal service is the best that you can get.

Then next up is when I'm renewing my identity card, I'm getting a little bit nervous about it, feeling that I might have forget a document or two. But everything seems to be fine and swift though. Just one form, a picture taken and digital thumb prints. I didn't get to chance to see how did I look in the picture, but peeping on the screen, it looked pretty good though :p.

Then at night, I went to the supermarket where my best friend, Kang Jun, is working and I get to chat with him. Business was pretty slow there when I met up with him, so that gives us a lot of time to chat like nobody's business. I get to know a lot of news updates about my old friends whom are not around, and the most saddening news that I heard was one of my friends' brother got killed in a car crash a month ago. My sympathies for him. Other than that, a few of my friends gets into a relationship, that's a good thing.

I was thinking of breaking out my news with Allen though… but then I held back, and the only thing that we chatted about in the relationship department is my ex-crush and nothing else. Walking home, I didn't felt too well emotionally though: no, it's nothing major, but it did kept me pondering a lot about me holding back the news. As much as that he was my best friend, I still can't find courage to tell him about it.

Is it that I'm avoiding the pain? (referring to the previous incident that I feel that a door being slammed on my face when I broke the news to another good friend of mine… well, I know Kang Jun is open to it, but yet…) Or is it that there's things that I don't really trust… whatever that is? Is it my initial doubts? Or is it the trust that I had for my friends and family? …Or is it that I doubt myself? I wished I knew though. Umm… Actually there's something that happened to my sweetie that I should feel at least unhappy, or at least jealous, but I didn't feel anything… Until now.

… I think I'm becoming a worry wart or something. Any sort of reassurance that I can get, anyone? Umm… anyone?

[:: Random Note ::]

Well… I have been using my family phone line, which is pretty much being extremely close to my family computer. So I won't be online much lately except for posting daily journal updates.
