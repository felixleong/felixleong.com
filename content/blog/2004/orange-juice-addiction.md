Wow… I think I caught up with an orange juice addiction. That's… not right. XD

Anyway, did more fine tuning to my Flash assignment and I'm glad to announce that the animation is done and final (with a few minor quirks that I'm too lazy to fix… well, let's see how things go then).The dog and pony show is scheduled on next Wednesday, so I hope this will be a blast. I'll do a few dance stints to explain some of the functions that I had incorporated. But for now, I'll keep it safe in my computer and will put it up on public after the presentation.

After finishing the Flash, I went to Midvalley megamall for a stress relieve stroll (and a few PPP games). And shoot! Tower Records has the MAX CD I recently bought and the cover is perfect (no fades!). As much as I didn't really liked the hot pink and mine with the fades looks cooler… I just feel more or less putting my brains into a really unnecessary dilemma. Then I also saw MAX's Perfect Collection CD (which I put on my future CD of the month list) and dream's Daybreak (I only wanted the Night of Fire music video, but the RM50 price doesn't justify for that one clip that I wanted… but I still feel the urge of getting it. Must… resist…).

Then, strolling in the bookshop, I saw tons of books which I really wanted to read yet computer books always have the near RM100 price tag, which made me a little bit reluctant to put them back on the shelf (since I'm pretty much cash strapped). Sigh! I do wonder why humans always desire more than we can afford, but then again, there's nothing wrong to dream and it is a good motivational factor. Hmm…

Anyway, my future list of CD of the month which I plan to get some time later (not exact titles): Ayumi Hamasaki's Duty, HARMONY (Ayumi meets Classical), Ayumi Hamasaki Stadium & Dome tour 2002 VCD, Hyper Eurobeat MAX, SEB presents EURO GLOBE, Namie Amuro Singles Collection (forget the name of the album, I know it's a bunch of numbers though), MAX Perfect Collection, Maxim the Piano Player, a bunch of classical music CDs… Darn! That's a LOOONG list.
