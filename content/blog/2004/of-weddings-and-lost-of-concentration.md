Today's Aunt Ling's wedding ceremony, it's pretty simple actually, but it went perfectly and I'm just happy to see her and Uncle Vincent married happily. ;)

As much as that, I have been thinking too much ever since yesterday: from what I have left off yesterday to my future plans. Perhaps so deep in thought it seems that I'm pretty much didn't paid attention to **anything**!

I'm still evaluating and considering whether I really need that digital camera, because that would really bang my budget by the thousands.

Going back to KL tomorrow, having a workshop going on Tuesday. I'm really looking forward to that, since I'll be going with the special someone (I think most of you should know who that is ;) ).

Felix signing off now.
