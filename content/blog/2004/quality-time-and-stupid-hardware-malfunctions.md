Considering that I didn't post yesterday, it can only mean one thing: I'm still not connected to the Internet back home :(. Apparently I still can't figure out how to make my Windows 95 machine to talk to the Internet. :(

Anyway, yesterday is pretty frustrating, my aunt's computer dead all of a sudden, my switch suddenly got fried or something, the new modem works perfectly but I still can't get online X(. *dies*

Thinking of getting a small form factor PC back home, but that would really bang me another grand from my loan money (darn you computers! *BLA-ZZZZ*) Anyway, as if I had a choice… :'(. (meaning: Less money to buy other stuff)

Other than that, I'm going to have some quality time with Choon Hui <3 ^^. Well… of course it is work related though, but I'm just glad with every single chance I got *^^*.

Bought Utada Hikaru's Single Collection Vol. 1 yesterday… and I would say that… umm… I didn't really liked it that much, perhaps due to the fact it have that kind of pop-ish feel in it? Don't get me wrong, but I always feel that pop music is a little bit too plain. Maybe I should listen to it a few times and let it grow in me, I suppose. But the lyrics are kinda good though, doesn't have that "instantly striked a chord in me" kind of feeling, but still it's beautifully written.
