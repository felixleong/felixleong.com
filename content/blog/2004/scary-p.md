When I access to LJ, I noticed that the the Live Post Stats is pretty… strange :p. Imagine seeing a perfect 18000 post/hour and 300/minute kind of numbers while you access LiveJournal.

Yesterday was pretty much a mixture of good and bad: Choon Hui seemingly giving me the impression that he's giving me the cold shoulders during the workshop :(. Well… he's extremely busy lately with work and stuff, which is really understandable, but I somewhat can't help but feeling a bit lonely at times like this.

Anyway, the good stuff is that my computer **finally** worked, stupid CPU front-side bus (FSB) jumper setting! So I pretty much spent the whole day fiddling with it :). And yeah for DVDs and super fast CD ripping!

The downside? My notebook hard drive and my new webcam just refuse to talk with it X(! ARGH!!!! I wonder what's wrong with the webcam, I need to try it out in another computer. I **swear** that I'll be careful with Logitech products because they always hate me. (anyhow I think I have to check with Logitech's tech support… as much I knew they won't be much help either)

And yeah! I *finally* decided to give Gmail a go! :) For those who wanted to mail me, add me in your address book with the mail address *felixleong(at)gmail.com*. Change the (at) into @ because I'm just paranoid with spammers :p (but then again, that's what GMail is up to do XD).

What else…. Well… I'm just off grabbing some freeware for my new compie. Till then, just hope that stupid webcam works.

[p/s: For some reason Utada seems to grow in me now :3]
