Stress attack! Great, mathematics always get me headaches, especially when I'm totally ill-prepared for today's quiz (Gah! Two questions and I have one of them totally blank *dies*) Ah well… Look like there's a lot of catching up to do. :p

Perhaps it's due to stress level or the heat around me, I have been having an annoying headache, it's nothing major, but it's just bothering to have it there while I'm going on with my daily tasks. Thank god my flash assignment is seeing better progress and I had almost finished Try Me ^\_^ v. Hopefully I can finish the project this week and go on with other stuff. But… *looks at the expiration date* gah! My trial version for Flash MX 2004 is going to end tomorrow! Thank god I had the evaluation copy of the older Flash MX to act as backup :p. But I better pray that it doesn't mess up with my previous works, I hate to readjust most of the stuff that I had done until now.

And yeah… it's boring lately. That's all.
