I got murdered in this paper >.<". I never expect that the paper came out to be a "do-or-die" paper, as in: 20 marks for each question, which really is a question that expects you to know the EXACT term or you just can't answer the whole question.

So there goes 60 marks after my really lame attempt to bullshit my way through section B. I suppose I'm able to fare well… well… at LEAST I think I'm able to pass my paper >.>.

Uh… Hope that doesn't foil my high GPA plan.

Let's see… Eurobeat CDs are selling like MAD in eBay. Uh… I better keep my hands off from there. Hmm… Let's see what's else…

Choon Hui seems to be calm, but… well… he doesn't seem to be happy with today's performance. ;\_; Well… just hope that the gloomy mood won't affect my studies today.

Anyway, at least I had an appointment with him :).

Next up: Interpersonal Communication on Friday morning! W00t! <3 (Sorry, I just liked the subject :p)
