*"Nothing much on the desk, but that's basically where the strategic plans are going to be rolled out. Wellâ€¦ maybe there should be less goodies on the desk XD."*

My stitches will be removed in around 24 hours! ^^

No classes today since every single one of them have been cancelled, so more time for studies, I suppose? Well, currently I'm still proscratinating in the lab checking my mails and stuff XD.

Warfare starts pretty soon, starting from the 4th September up to the 15th. It's going to be tough, but with enough preparation, I suppose I will survive :).

Probably this LJ will either have not much updates, or filled with exam related rants (like last semester), but we'll see how it goes. Just keep my fingers crossed for now.
