1. **MY Para Para Fantasy site got registered**

    First of all, our (as in Tommy and I and the rest of the team) group has just registered a free domain in Topcities. Currently I'm still drafting the whole thing for our website… hopefully the designed can be finished soon (I need to type all the contents by myself for the time being though). The advert on top of the page and the 600M/month bandwidth is quite disturbing, but… well… guess it's okay for a start :).

2. **Time management**

    Eeek! Now I got my hands on some schoolwork and I found out my time is just not enough for me to do a lot of things. I don't know, I always panic at times of chaos (well… frankly speaking, the chaos is nothing compared to real thing. Over-reacting, I suppose ^_^" ). Guess I do need to do some time management stuff and prioritize my work, but then again, it's not as easy as been told in self-help books… (hmm… the irony)

3. **R.I.P.**

    My CD-ROM is officially dead. Will be going to the shop this Saturday, hope they won't be delaying or denying the replacement effort (I can't leave my Eurobeat collection there! I don't want to wear out my CDs!)

4. **Eurobeat CDs!**

    I just found a shop that sells move's Operation 7 (featuring Gamble Rumble) and SEB presents JGTC 2000! If only my timetable and my wallet would allow me to go there and get it…

5. **Lastly…**

    Well, I'm looking forward to tomorrow's Microsoft TechNet event (got to skip lectures for this ^\_^"), just hope that I'll be able to wake up early, get there early, and have fun!
