*"Every backyard contains some tiny little surprises. (Picture taken from the laundry room)"*

---

Just a shortie:

- I saw squirrels in our backyard <3, they look so cute ^^. Too bad they do run pretty fast before I can flash my camera at them
- Stitches planned to be gone tonight if there's no surprises (Yeah for having that itchy sensation off from meâ€¦ or at least that's what I assume to be)
- Attending an artificial intelligence seminar later, it's going to fun (at least I know someone would be there, no prizes for guessing :p)
- NO ONE would be telling me to visit [Happy Tree Friends](http://www.happytreefriends.com/) again @\_@". One episode is enough to amuse and disturb me at the same time.

Signing off now :).
