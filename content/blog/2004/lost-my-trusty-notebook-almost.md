title: Lost My Trusty Notebookâ€¦ Almost

Nothing really special occur to me today, but I almost thought that my trusty notebook is going to be lost today. In case you are wondering, the notebook that I mentioned isn't the computer kind of notebook (which I use to type this journal every time ;) ), but a ring-binded, navy blue paper notebook (or notepad, which some might put it).

Basically if you peep inside my notebook, it isn't much stuff inside: My almighty timetable, things that I jotted down, a few fragmented ideas, and perhaps a lot of artwork scribbles (a few poems has been taken out from there, although most of them are typed into my computer). Think of it, it really isn't something that anyone would considered important or scream about, but I panicked when I forgot where I left it. But thank god, a friend found it somewhere and returned it back to me.

Phew! Close call. I think I better remember to take my personal stuff next time (as much as I know that I have a really nasty forgetful nature)

My favourite game music MIDI search engine is back up again! Wee! [Computer Music Center](http://www.dtm.ac/) IS in Japanese, but I guess you can guess which link to click ;)
