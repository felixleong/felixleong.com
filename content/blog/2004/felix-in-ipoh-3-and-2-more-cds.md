OK, let's mention the CDs first which I just got from a shop during my trip to Ipoh (more on that later): SEB presents HYPER EURO MAX and SEB presents EURO global (and I got the last copy, MWAHAHAHA, I'm evil :p). I haven't listened to EURO global yet, but I just finished with HYPER EURO MAX, and there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the CD is really good! The bad news is that if you have owned SEB100, you'll notice the 3 MAX tracks is TOTALLY similar (OK, I should have said that it's TOTALLY the same with *really* slight enhancements) to the ones in SEB100's J-Pop Remix Special CD (namely 閃光‐ひかり‐のVEIL, Love impact and Ride on time), with different titles. What a rip-off! I was expect at least a totally new remix, and no~~~ Not to mention that the CD is *less* than an hour (close though). Well… at least the other tracks are really spectacular that covers my rants under the hood. Ah well… Perhaps lemme just pop in globe's CD instead now.

Enough of the CD stuff, let me just flashback a bit. Anyway, I decided to go to Ipoh today, which is a big town next to my home town (Kuala Kangsar), just to scrape any CDs that I would want, and as well try to see whether there's any paralist around. So there I go, exchanging buses to go from mall to mall, and stroll around to see whether is there any new stuff around. Well… to my disappointment, well… nothing changed :p. And yeah, that's a bit boring.

But in Ipoh Parade (one of the bigger malls there), I accidentally bumped into a poster of Wind Dance Group, one of the paralist groups in Ipoh. I do feel a bit suspicious since I saw the *exact* poster last year XD (which is still the same ol' stuff printed on A4 paper). Well… there's phone numbers listed there, so I just messaged them and didn't expect a reply (especially when you just can't seem to get any signals. Stupid DiGi [<< my cellphone operator]!). And I did! XD

But I do have to wait until 4:30 to actually see them in person. But it's fun anyway, you know, having someone to dance together and stuff *^^*. Too bad they have to leave at 5. Anyway, they do invite me to come over tomorrow… Hmm… buying two CD has already banged my wallet hard. Ah well… I guess I might pop up tomorrow to promote our message forums ;).

Anyway, hope that tomorrow will be fun ^^.
