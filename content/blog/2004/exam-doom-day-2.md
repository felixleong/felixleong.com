Phew… I did pretty well for today's subject: Database Systems. Well… considering that I spent the whole night catching all my stuff, I'm pretty much consider myself doing quite well… Possibly an A if the lecturer is a bit lenient. But it's beyond my control right now.

Anyway, the worst part of the day is that:

- I didn't really slept yesterday, perhaps except for the 2 and a half hours of catnap and some occasional doze-offs. So I can really foresee that I'll not be all looking fresh for the whole week… I suppose. (*cough*, my body's tendency to repay sleep debt)
- God the air conditioner is blowing in my direction in the exam hall, and it's freezing cold in there. I felt like I was in a refrigerator after 30 minutes, then I got the nerve to request one of the examination staff to turn it down, which makes me feel comfy for an hour and feeling cold during the remaining critical minutes I had. That was a shivering experience to me (And I swear on the name of God that I'll remember to bring my jacket with me!)

What else… Well… just got the worry wart problem, there's just a few people (all of them that I had at least previously had a crush on), whether online or real life friends, didn't look well these day, mostly emotionally. As much as I believe they can handle it themselves, I just feel a bit concerned and hope that I can help as much as I could. Hmm… Is it a call for being used than being needed? Well… I don't know. It's worrying yet I don't feel negative about it, the sweetness of caring, I suppose.

Anyway, this week will be a good roller coaster ride, I guess I'll hit the books after I had a 30 minute snooze afterwards. Ja 'ne!
