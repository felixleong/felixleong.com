Hmmâ€¦ It's kind of fun, so I guess I just post a basic summary of our case study today:

Your friend has been passing up his assignment which he has been downloaded from the Internet, and you know that he's doing so. However, you also know that your university is really strict on plagiarism and will bar anyone who is doing anything against "academic honesty" (which your friends is doing it). However, there's also a rule that those who know but didn't report about it will be punished as well (i.e. being barred from taking examinations).

So basically, what would you do?

1. Ask your friend to surrender himself. Failing of doing so will mean that you will report him instead.
2. Report about your friend's act immediately
3. Give him a warning that if he does it again, you'll report him
4. Do nothing

Please state your stand (select only one option) and give your reasons.

[p/s: this question is originally in Malay and I translate it almost literally. :p Hope you don't mind the slight errors here and there]

Our group chose Option 1. What's your stand?

Wish me luck, tomorrow's doom's day (assignment due)
