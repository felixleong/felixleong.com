Should have typed this yesterday… but oh well.

Ever got cornered by your crush with relationship related questions?

Well, that happens to me. Basically, it just happens that I manage to get my chance to go to one of those security device expos with him (and a couple of friends), and I'm really excited not because of the expo but having the chance to sit next to Choon Hui on the car (talk about skewed intentions here ^^") But then again, I do want to know some security camera and current advances so that I can think of some applications for my final year project.

It was drizzling then, and we just arrived first and we have to wait for our friends on another car. Then I just noticed that there's a lush green golf course just next to the exhibition centre. As much as I cringe over golf courses (Heck! How much trees they have to cut down for that golf course! >=( ), I just liked the greens a lot, and the drizzle have certainly made the grass patch looked fresh and lively. Then I notice that Choon Hui is just next to me, looking at the greens with much interest, and it's kind of surprising when I heard that he also wished to stay somewhere near to nature *^^*.

When we notice the notice saying that the expo isn't opened to general public, somewhat that statement did made us a little bit uncomfortable. But we just barge in anyway XD. Asking the receptionist there, apparently we are allowed to get in there, and we get a blue student tag to go with it. The exhibition is pretty much filled with security cameras, security key cards systems and nothing else, which is a bit disappointing since our intention is to see any face recognition systems and any computer applications that worked with the cameras. We manage to find a few of them, and basically Choon Hui is asking all the questions. Hmm…

On our way back, we did talk about our interest and stuff and there goes the relationship topic running again: Well, basically what qualities do you look in a lover (umm, as much as the direction is to girls, obviously). Then the conversation goes like:

Choon Hui (CH): "Did you feel in love before?"

Me: "Yeah… *looks out from the window and see a familiar building outside* Ah~ That does bring back memories!"  
CH: "Is it?"  
Me: "Well, I came here once when I was in Form Four, and I remember this place clearly"  
CH: "Oh, with your first love?"  
Me: *twitches* "Oh no, my first love is much more later than that… not to mention that it's one-sided." *chuckles*  
CH: *smiles* "You should have more courage to tell her about it."

Me: "Nah… sometimes I just feel like there's some times that you better keep them to yourself." (especially when you know that the one that you admire is not gay/bi and with a girlfriend)  
CH: "Yeah, I agree with that… so do you like someone now?"  
Me: "Umm… yeah" (and he's sitting right next to me)  
CH: "Oh, really? :3" *insert tons of questions that how the … ummm, <i>girl</i> looks like*  
Me: *twitches again while trying to answer as vaguely as possible*  
CH: "I know who she is! She's in my groups right?" (apparently my previous female crush is IN his group)  
Me: "Yeah" (But I'm referring to you… ;\_;)  
CH: *jokingly* "Do you want me to help you out or anything?"

Me: *feel slightly disappointed* "Nevermind, I think I can settle it by myself."

Sometimes I just don't really understand why people would make assumptions that everyone is straight when it comes to boyfriend/girlfriend questions. And somewhat I'm feeling the urge to tell him the truth but the situation have made me to hold everything back (well… there're others who's in the car). And for some reasons… I just don't feel like risking a friend, and I didn't know him for too long. It's kinda… well, hurts in some way.

And today I just did a few more silly stuff in front of him today that does make me feel stupid myself. >\_<" I just hope that things will improve… well… on the bright side of things, at least I knew his birth date yesterday (18 August). Ah~ The confident Leo.
