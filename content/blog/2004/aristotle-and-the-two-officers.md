Ah… Student Affairs Department… sounds more to me like a Student Torture Chamber. OK, the staff there aren't that bad like what I had just described just now, but there's one that I know about them: I don't like to go there in the first place. Sheesh… OK, it's really not that bad, but there's just one officer over there who has a dang lot of nervous energy that she always amplifies one mistake like it's was a catastrophe in the public eye (OK, I'm slightly exaggerating, but you get the point). Worse still, the department is so underemployed that the staff also has inherited the same nervous energy. Geez… That means that when I going there to get my loan forms handed up or passing up posters, they would scrutinize every single detail like a vulture waiting for its prey (in this case, they're like giving me the impression that I can go wrong with everything!) And since I get nervous very easily, I'm like walking through the minefield whenever I wanted to open that door.

On the other hand, the head of that department is pretty much the opposite: as much she would like things to be in control, she's pretty calm in nature and she always assure us that as long we work together, we can iron things straight. Sigh… if we had more people like that.

Anyway, today's moral class is about Aristotle's Mean Virtues. Woo… it's kind of fun that the lecturer putting it simply as being matured in terms of our thinking and actions. Moral classes are fun (although the SAD has made me skipped a quarter of it #$#^$\*)
