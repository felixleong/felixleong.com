LJ ate two of my longer entries, so yeah I definitely going to keep it short this time :p.

Today's exams pretty much went… unexpected XD. I don't know, it's like the question really came to be quite unexpected in the sense that it really differs with most exams questions I have attempted so far. I don't know, it's like what I read the whole night yesterday is a waste of time :p. But overall I think I managed to pull it off quite well… hope I can score in this one.

Yesterday has been pretty enlightening to me though, been talking to Steven regarding different issues in life, and I have been enlighthen in a way. Guess there's more things for me to learn these days.

As an unrelated note, the good thing is that I finally finished with my Ayumi Hamasaki album collection <333. W00t! The bad news: now with my Ayu collection completed, I don't know which artist to collect next XD. Anybody with good music recommendations? :3 (I was thinking of classical *prods Deshy* and JPop right now… currently considering to collect globe or to test out with V6…)

Another sad thing is that my notebook is repaired but the LCD is dead ;\_\_\_;. I'm not sure whether the notebook is totally dead or not… I have to wait until I get it first >.>.

So next up… and the last chapter in Exam Hell: Software Engineering this Wednesday afternoon! Wish me luck this time :3.

[:: extra stuff ::]

- Glad that Choon Hui is still sweet <3, I just love that guy :p
- Been into the parapara groove just now… 40 minutes of non-stop J-Euros are always fun :)
