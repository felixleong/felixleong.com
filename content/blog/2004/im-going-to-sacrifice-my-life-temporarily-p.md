Due to assignments, I'm not going to have a life for a few days in order to get the hell (read: assignments) out from my schedules. Ugh… I hate doing every single thing on my own when I had a group >.<". That's the "control-freak & giving-control" dilemma. (*note: Argh! Why I always stumble at this word! *note to self: should be double *m*'s instead of *l*'s)

But at least not all life have been sucked out from my soul, within 5 hours I'm going to win another CD =3… and Choon Hui looked great in his khaki coloured, checker-patterned shirt (since he's usually in tees). <333 Ah… just the little things which inject some fun in life.
(* I don't think this is the right word, anyone care to improve my vocab? :3)

[:: UPDATE ::]

Wee~ Just won Lolita's Try Me album from eBay <333! ^^
