First off, some disappointment rants:

- Dom's mom forgets to send my package ;\_\_\_\_; … (on the bright side of things, at least I know it isn't stuck at the customs)
- There's a book warehouse sale that I really wanted to check out today, and I'm trying to "date" Choon Hui out together. But he said that he wanted to get back home today so… ;\_\_\_\_\_;

    … I ended up going there alone. Well… it's pointless to spoil the fun anyway ^^. So there I go, I thought the venue is within walking distance, so I decided to walk there. And I didn't knew that I took the long way and I ended up walking a REALLY long distance to get there. But once I get there… WOW! The place is HUGE! Tables with books stacked on them always make my eyes sparkle (OK~ I have to admit that I'm a bookworm :p). Can't believe they sell Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix for RM47!!! (GOD I pay RM20 extra for my copy >.<)

    Got a bunch of computer books there (I'm overspending again XDDD), then I decided to get a few classics like Peter Pan, Frankenstein and Gulliver's Travel for some light reading (and it's only RM3 <333). Got some books for my friends (including one for Choon Hui <333)… and then the next thing I know: I used up all my cash XDDD.

    It looks like my house is within walking distance, so I decided to walk home instead with my heavy books… and gosh I AM wrong again! The burden have certainly make it seem like a even farther journey than it should. *dies from walking* Took me about an hour to reach home, and by the time I reach home, I slept for two hours due to fatigue XDDD.

Lastly, Nine have edited my vids <333, can't wait to see once the download has finished. ^^
