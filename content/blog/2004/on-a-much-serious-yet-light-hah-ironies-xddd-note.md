After all that pented fury being release elsewhere (my LJ, actually), it seems that I'm able to get my defensiveness and ego down to go to meet up with the Students Affairs Department (I wonder whether I should capitalise that… Any English grammarians around?). But nonetheless I'm feeling a bit nervous when I entered the room, then pretty much my priorities are being set straight: That I would really want this to work out and I want the freshmen to have a booklet that would set the expectations and hopes for the university themselves.

Then I remember what the message that I really wanted to convey, in whatever art form I design: A beginning of journey with hopes, together with a sense of togetherness, unity and harmony, to set out for a change for the better.

So yeah, with that in mind, I have more creative energy to do more designs now :).

So I'll post up any new designs that came to mind over here and I would really appreciate any feedback from you ^^. Hopefully it'll come out to be great ^^b.

This morning when I was at the bus stop, a butterfly just seem to captivate me ^^, an orange one in fact. Then looking back, there's more of them :D.

… Just one of those things that I didn't notice all the while, I guess. :)

Anyway, classes in half an hour, and I really need to grab something for lunch. See you guys then! :)

## #3:

There's a lot of reasons for me to be happy today, and one, no, three of the most important one is that:

1. Today's Stanley's birthday :3
2. …And my parents' wedding anniversary! Congrats for 23 years of being in marriage and as much I know you guys never read my LJ, I'm proud of having you as parents *HUGZ!!!*
3. … I'll save that for tommorrow's entry :).

I think I just give my parents a ring tonight :3.
